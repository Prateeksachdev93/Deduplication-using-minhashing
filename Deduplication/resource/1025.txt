Abstract Purpose: The current study explores the adolescentsâ€™ understanding and attitudes towards sexual
abstinence and whether differences in definitions differ by age, gender, ethnicity, and sexual experience.
Methods: A qualitative exploratory approach was used for this study. A total of six focus group
discussions (FGDs) were conducted with the teenagers who enrolled at the Meriting secondary school at
Kgabalatsane.
Results: The findings confirm that concerns surrounding emotional and physical health outcomes
associated with sexual understanding were the key driving force behind decision-making around sexual
abstinence. Sexual abstinence is an approach for promoting protection against emotional and physical
health hazards. The perceptions on sexual abstinence was determined by the (1) individualâ€™s fears, (2) a
desire for a better future, (3) love of material goods , (4) abuse of alcohol and drugs; and (5) a good
parent-child relationships.
Conclusions: Teenagers conceptualise sexual abstinence differently, with differences by age, gender and
sexual experience. This suggests that sexual health promotion campaigns and interventions need to be
developed with an understanding of the meaning and the value teenagers attach to sexual abstinence.
