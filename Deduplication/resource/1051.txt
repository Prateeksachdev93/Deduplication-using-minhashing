Title:
Female philopatry and male-mediated gene flow in Argyrosomus inodorus (Griffiths &amp;
Heemstra, 1995)
Aim:
To determine whether Argyrosomus inodorus represents a single or multiple stocks. Using
mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers, we intended to determine the genetic
variation between and within A. inodorus populations/morphological stocks.
Abstract:
Silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus) has been divided into four morphologically distinct
stocks, one along the Namibian coast and three in South African waters. Due to the nature
of the marine species environment, a significant insight into their behaviours, natural history
as well as current influences and historical population demography is needed. The present
study examines the genetic variation at mitochondrial and microsatellite level. Mitochondrial
DNA analyses for three populations: Namibia, southern Cape and southeastern Cape,
shows genetic variation structuring. Microsatellite data revealed that there is a definite
structuring between the South Africa populations and Namibian one. These results provide
evidence that there is some form of gene flow among the South African stocks and between
Namibia and South Africa. At the same time, the results raised the question in which
direction the gene flow is carried out.
