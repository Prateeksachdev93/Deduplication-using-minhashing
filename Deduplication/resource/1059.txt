Keyword : Global trade management
Topic : Trade management in B2B industry
There are many factors that must be considered for effective global trade management to
occur, regardless of what you are trading and with whom you are trading it with. It is important
to have an understanding of the HS Code, or Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding
System of tariff nomenclature, which is associated with the products you are trading. It is also
important to consider the landing cost of everything you import in order to keep expenditures
to a minimum. And this is just the beginning.
The HS Code is an especially crucial component of any international trade scheme. The code is
an internationally standardized system of names and numbers for classifying traded products,
which was developed and is maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO), formerly
known as the Customs Co-operation Council. The independent intergovernmental organization
is integral to global trade management with more than 170 member countries and a
headquarters in the financial hub of Brussels, Belgium.
Understanding all thefactors of an organizationâ€™s logistics, including the landed cost of imports,
allows for a more competitive edge in the global market. The landed cost is the most popular
and widely used performance measure employed to examine the efficiency of an organizationâ€™s
logistics, consisting of the total cost involved with purchasing, transporting, warehousing and
distributing raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods. Organizations must be able to
factor all these costs into their logistical scheme to have success in whatever market they are
trading in.
Luckily, there are software tools that make it easier to determine all the proper codes and
calculate all the related costs for international trading. These modern tools free up time and
resources for more important matters involved with running a global trade management
business. Now international movers and shakers can use efficient and accurate Harmonized
System Commodity Classification tools and intelligent, easy to use software systems that
reduce customs compliance errors and lower the cost of global trade.
