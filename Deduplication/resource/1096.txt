Major Project Report

SYNOPSIS
Rocking isolation is a phenomenon that occurs in inverted pendulum structural systems
supported by spread foundations, where the largest load is applied at the highest point of
the structure. Previous research and observation on the matter has been able to prove a
number of positive effects it has on a structure during a seismic event, effects that may
allow for it to avoid failure. However, there are also effects that may create a hazard in the
safety of the structureâ€™s users rather than its structural integrity alone. A general
examination of the various aspects of the structural isolation observed in a typical bridge
structure during rocking is conducted in this paper in order to establish an objective
perspective on the fundamental benefits that arise from the effects of this astounding
phenomenon.

CHAPTER 1 â€“ INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Rocking Isolation Effect
Seismic events occur in significantly large parts of the world and it is a random
phenomenon that plays a weighted role in the design of structures in the affected regions.
Bridge piers are typically supported by spread foundations where the underlying soil
conditions are stable. It has been observed in the past that usually during bidirectional
seismic excitations, bridge piers have responded by rocking on their foundations allowing in
some cases for failure to be avoided. In essence the rocking acts as an isolator to the
superstructure. By definition rocking isolation is the foundation uplift response of the
superstructure supported by a shallow, spread footing. Typically the superstructure must be
an inverted pendulum type of structural system - bridges or elevated tank reservoirs â€“
where the largest mass is situated at the highest point of the structure. In these structures,
a seismic excitation will induce substantially large bending moments at the base of the pier
and in turn instigate very large moment-curvature demands in the pier element of the
superstructure.
It has been observed that in typical rocking isolation cases, the material underlying the
footing support must be elastic in order to provide an elastic response. This is typically a
response with reactions showing a decrementing trend of magnitude when subjected to the
pounding force received by the rocking of the footing. This will allow for the dissipation of
seismic energy away from the superstructure and into the underlying soil.
Current codes of bridge seismic design in various parts of the world do not take foundation
uplift and its consequent rocking isolation effect into account. The probability of foundation
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 2 - | P a g e
uplift occurring during a seismic event is minimised by overdesigning the spread
foundations, designing for wider, heavier foundations.
This rocking acts as an isolator to the superstructure, dissipating some of the seismic
energy into the underlying soil causing the plastic hinge to develop there first and not at the
pier critical section, aiding in avoiding flexural failure.
In Figure 1 -1 (a) the pier base is assumed to be fixed; rocking is limited due to the large
footing size. As a result large curvature demands are observed in the pier and a plastic
hinge is developed at the critical section of the pier. In contrast, Figure 1 -1 (b) shows a
rocking ability -due to a smaller footing size- resulting in significantly smaller curvature
demands observed in the pier as well as the development of the plastic hinge in the
underlying soil. It should be noted that in this paper only the rocking isolation of the footing-
pier-deck system was examined and no investigation into the formation of the plastic hinge
in the soil was conducted.

1.2 Analysed Structure
The structure analysed is an existing typically reinforced concrete bridge supported by
spread foundations. The superstructure consists of a continuous plate girder deck which is
connected to the piers by bearings which allow for bidirectional translation in the x-y plane
(plan view). The general support to the large weight of the bridge deck is provided by the 2
abutments â€“ one on either side â€“ and 4 reinforced concrete bridge piers which are identical
in geometry, dimension and reinforcement. The bridge piers are then supported by spread
footing foundations constructed in a 4m deep layer of sand.

1.3 Scope of Work
The significance of the effect that the rocking isolation has on a structureâ€™s moment
capacity, curvature demands and ductility demands was examined in this paper. The
influence of various parameters on the rocking isolation and the subsequent response of
the superstructure were also examined:
ï‚· The size of the spread foundation supporting the bridge pier
ï‚· The stiffness of the underlying soil
Adding up, the influence of the rocking isolation effect on the response of the structure and
it properties were also examined:
ï‚· The moment capacity of the pier
ï‚· The moment-curvature relationship of the pier
ï‚· Ductility demands of the pier
In this paper the inelastic rocking of the footing of the footing-pier-deck system was
analysed in order to conclude on an educated, objective opinion on the impact of the
rocking isolation on the structureâ€™s critical and serviceability limit states.

CHAPTER 2 - LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Historic Case Studies
Yashinky and Karshenas (2003) were two researchers inspired by the events of the 1995
Kobe earthquake in Japan which caused numerous structural damages, causing in some
cases loss of human life. Specifically the damages incurred on Highway Route 3 in Kobe
were found to be of interest. Route 3 crossed over a long highway bridge supported by
single cylindrical piers at regular, equal intervals. The effects on these columns were
monitored by the two researchers. They found that piers supported by wide footings had
developed a plastic hinge at the pier critical section, which had dramatically decreased the
moment capacity of the structure. This was found to be due to the large weight of the
footings which limited the rotation of the structure and hence incurred large curvature
demands on the pier. On the contrary it was observed that piers with smaller footings had
substantially less damages. For example, Pier 697 remained undamaged due to the fact
that the foundation of the pier was allowed to rock hence an elastic response of the
structure to the excitation. More specifically, this caused a significant increase in the
structureâ€™s rotation but kept its design moment capacity and curvature demands mostly
intact.

Several other cases of seismic events and foundation rocking were investigated around the
world. In particular, the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in the United Kingdom was of
specific interest. It was observed that the foundation rocking phenomenon managed to
avert catastrophic damages to a 10-storey steel structure office building. The buildingâ€™s
structural elements avoided flexural damage due to the rocking response of the structureâ€™s
spread foundations and the increase of the structureâ€™s rotation capability. However, the
pounding of the footing impacting the underlying soil during the rocking caused uneven
settlements in the underlying soil causing the superstructure to tilt slightly. (Earthquake
Engineering Research Institute 2011).
2.2 Experiments
Various experiments of different types are needed to substantially model the effects of a
seismic event on a structure and the magnitude of probabilistic damages that could be
imposed by the seismic loading onto the various structural elements. The effects of footing
rocking, foundation uplift and lateral sliding are all tested and monitored in these tests under
initially monotonic and then cyclic and dynamic loading. The results documented provide
valuable insight on the behaviour of structural systems in the occurrence of a seismic event
and indicate the potential to minimise damages to the superstructure by attempting to
isolate the seismic loading to the substructure.
2.2.1 In-Situ Field Tests
A number of in situ tests have been conducted over the last 37 years, all of them aiming to
provide knowledge and information on the elastoplastic response of structures to various
seismic excitations. Such tests provided vital information which allowed for further
understanding of the rocking phenomenonâ€™s properties.
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 8 - | P a g e
A number of in-situ tests were conducted by Bartlett (1976) who used 1g cyclic loading
conditions on cohesive soils that could be compressed and consolidated. These tests were
conducted on rectangular plate footings, which were meant to model and simulate the
behaviour of realistic spread foundations in cohesive soil conditions. The test results
revealed the fact that the foundation rocking phenomenon which consequently lead to the
uplift of the footing, could lead to the ability to variably change the structureâ€™s loading period
experienced.
Another test was conducted by Wiessing (1979) again using the same 1g cyclic loading
conditions as before, however now the foundation soil was selected to be frictional soil
(cohesion-less). In this test the soil structure interaction was now given higher significance
where the connection between soil deformation and structure elasticity as well as the
potential of energy dissipation were studied. The results of this test indicated that the
foundation rocking time duration was linearly proportional to the settlement of the
foundation soil. It was also found that the increasing time of foundation rocking was linearly
proportional to the dissipation of energy induced by the seismic loading thus proving a
benefit in the foundation rocking response.
2.2.2 Shake Table Tests
As part of the TRISEE European Union research program, a number of models were tested
using a shake table facility. Negro et al. (2000) as a part of this research program produced
two models to be tested. The models to be used were two square footings 1m2 in plan and
each would be tested in two different foundation soil conditions, one with relatively low and
one with relatively high density sand. The loading conditions of 1g would be the same as
before and pseudo-static cyclic loading would be imposed on the two models to determine
their behavior in simplified earthquake conditions.
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 9 - | P a g e
It was observed that there was a relationship between vertical settlement and the density of
the sand as well as footing rotation magnitude. Specifically as the density of the sand
decreased, the footing rotation increased, consequently so did the vertical settlement.
Another observation was that the foundation responded to the loading linearly up to the
point where the footing rotation reached a critical rotation, Î¸cr â‰ˆ 2 - 6 x 10-3 rad, after which
the foundation behaves non-linearly.
Another shake table test experiment produced was that of Espinoza and Mahin (2006). The
loading conditions used to simulate earthquake conditions were 1 and 2-dimensional
dynamic shaking. This time an inverted pendulum structural system was used. A reinforced
concrete single column bridge model was used with a dimension scale factor, Î»=0.222. A
highly elastic synthetic rubber simulated the underlying soil; neopropene -Duro-60. This
was in order to account for the restrained loading capability of the shake table. As
described by Deng (2012) â€œthe model used was equipped with spread foundations which
had the ability to uplift and re-centreâ€. The model was kept the same but was tested 70 or
more times with varying sizes of square footings. Espinoza and Mahin (2006) observed the
results and concluded that in most of the models no damage had occurred to any structural
element which was credited to the foundation rocking capability of the structure which acted
as a relative base isolator to the superstructure. Another observation was that the
displacements observed, Î´ were measured to be less than or equal to the displacements in
a comparable bridge with a fixed base foundation of a corresponding size. Here another
benefit of rocking isolation was indicated; no real difference between maximum
displacements of a conventional fixed bridge pier.
Another significant shake table test was conducted by Sakellaraki et. al. (2005) who used a
footing-column-deck model with a varying deck mass. In this experiment the lateral stability
was restrained however foundation uplift was allowed. The model was made up of an
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 10 - | P a g e
elastic column and a spread, shallow foundation. Once again the loading conditions were
dynamic shaking and periodic cyclic loading in order to simulate earthquake conditions. The
results of these tests indicated that the effect of foundation uplift affected significantly the
systemâ€™s period experienced and hence its dynamic response to cyclic loading.
Hung et al. (2011) performed another set of shake table tests this time including pseudo
dynamic tests and cyclic loading tests to simulate simplified earthquake conditions. The
model used included a 6 story structure with cylindrical reinforced concrete columns which
was loaded under these conditions. The tests were broken down into two conditions, one
where the base of the columns were allowed to uplift and the other where the base of the
columns were fixed â€“ e.g. having very wide in plan footing foundations. The maximum
displacement, rocking moment capacity and moment at the base of both tested conditions
were recorded and then compared to provide basic conclusions. It was observed that the
column vibration period decreased when the base of the column was fixed. On the other
hand when the base of the column was allowed to uplift, the period increased and hence
minimised the probability of flexural damage to the pier. A decrementing excitation period or
loading frequency increases the magnitude of displacements and consequently the
probability of flexural damage in the column and vice versa for an incrementing frequency.
It was hence concluded that the foundation uplift was mainly responsible for significantly
decreasing the probability of flexural damage to the structure during a seismic event. Shake
table tests provide a straightforward experimental method to study the effects of seismic
loading on structures, however they show restraints in their performance and thus limit the
significance of their results. Firstly they limit the size of the foundation structural model due
to the relatively small size of the table test â€“ approximately 1m2 in plan. Secondly the
simulation and portrayal of the underlying foundation soil is too simplistic due to the lack of
confining stresses in the modeled soil, stresses existent in-situ soil. And thirdly shake table
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 11 - | P a g e
tests do not always have the ability to produce the required magnitude of seismic excitation
that would be dimensionally proportional to the model. This causes the model dimensions
to be limited to a relatively small degree; which in turn hinders the accuracy of results
produced. It is for these disadvantages that the inaccuracies of the shake table test can be
alternated by another test, the centrifuge model test.
2.2.3 Centrifuge Model Tests
Specifically, centrifuge model tests that indicated significant trends and relationships
between the structural modelâ€™s rotation stiffness, moment at the deck and footing rotation,
were conducted at the facilities of University of California Davis over a period of 4 years.
The researchers were Rosebrook (2001), Phalen (2003) and Gajan et al. (2005).
They conducted a series of centrifuge model tests on rigid wall models with shallow
foundations that were allowed to uplift (Deng, 2012).
These tests produced dependable results due to their varying parameters, which allowed
for an all-rounded, balanced conclusion to be determined by the researchers.

Gajan et al. managed to show a connection between the rotational stiffness of the structure
and foundation uplift. This was achieved by comparing the moment at the deck and rotation
of the footing over excitation periods experienced by the structural model. A connection was
determined by monitoring the results of the tests and it was observed that the incrementing
moment and rotation angle of the footing were both linearly proportional to vertical
settlement occurring in the underlying foundation soil. It was also observed that with
increasing rotation angle, increased moments were allowed to take place on the structure.
This essentially shows that foundation rocking caused the degradation of the structureâ€™s
rotational stiffness and therefore increased its moment capacity.
These tests also managed to highlight a relationship between the rocking effect, the
structureâ€™s design factor of safety and the underlying foundation soilâ€™s relative density.
The rocking effect seems to be inversely proportional to the design factor of safety of the
footing and the relative density of the foundation soil respectively. Hence, by decreasing the
footing size in plan â€“ decreasing its safety factor â€“and the relative density of the underlying
soil, the rocking effect increases.
Therefore the centrifuge model tests produced by Gajan et al. were detrimental in indicating
advantages of the foundation rocking phenomenon. The structural moment capacity
increases when its foundations are allowed to uplift and rotate, hence making - in
probabilistic terms - the structure less susceptible to flexural damage.

Ugalde et al. (2007) and Ugalde et al. (2010) produced a series of centrifuge model tests
using varying dimensions of circular in plan foundation footing to support a bridge model
with an elastic column. Hence, it is assumed that no plastic straining and no residual
displacement occur in the column. The bridge model was tested under simulated dynamic
seismic loading conditions in a foundation soil of sand of varying densities.
Ugalde et al. aimed at using the tests to compare results and provide a conclusion on the
effect of the change of the footing dimensions -in plan- on the magnitude of foundation
rocking. The effect of the foundation rocking phenomenon on the bridge columnâ€™s moment
capacity and rotational stiffness was also determined.
It was observed that by comparing the varying size of the footing to the moment
experienced by the bridge model and the rotation experienced by the foundation, that when
the size of the footing decreased in plan the footing rotation and the column moment
capacity increased. By decreasing the size of the footing in plan, the rotational stiffness of
the column and the acceleration demands on the deck proportionally decreased causing

the centrifuge models discussed above showing the modelâ€™s
increasing moment capacity with increasing rotation angle of
the footing (Gajan et al., 2005)
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 14 - | P a g e
the displacement demands on the deck to increase (Deng 2012). This was credited to the
rocking of the modelâ€™s foundation which dissipated energy induced by the seismic loading
and hence reduced the moment experienced.
It was then concluded that the bridge design of smaller (in plan), spread foundations that
can rock should be preferred instead of wide, spread foundations that are considered fixed.
As a discussion, Gajan and Kutter (2008) re-examined the results of the centrifuge model
tests produced by Rosebrook (2001), Phalen (2003) and Gajan (2005) using the facilities at
the University of California Davis. The discussion was mainly focused on the effects of the
rocking of shallow and spread foundations phenomenon on bridges, such as the structureâ€™s
energy dissipation, the columnâ€™s moment capacity and short-term settlements of the
underlying soil experienced by the foundations.
It was hence observed that structures with a large footing ratio of A/Ac showed a number of
positive properties that improve its seismic response. One of these properties was the
ability of the foundation to present a self-centering mechanism during foundation uplift and
rocking. This is an important property as it avoids the creation of plastic straining caused
by displacement of structural members. Another property that occurs when this footing ratio
is large is that substantial energy dissipation occurs â€“up to a viscous damping ratio value of
Î¾â‰ˆ 20%- which aids in decreasing the seismic loading that enters the structure.
Also, the footing was observed to have no induced permanent vertical settlement, Ïâˆž.
It was hence concluded and suggested that for bridges; the design of shallow, rocking
foundations together with artificial dampeners should be introduced as preferential in bridge
design rather than fixed-base columns.

CHAPTER 3 - NUMERICAL MODELLING
3.1 Moment-Curvature Analysis at the Critical Section of the Pier
Here the results of the moment-curvature (M-Ï†) analysis of the critical section at the base of
the pier are presented. For this analysis the program Response2000 was used which
specialises in rectangular, concrete cross-sections. The general material properties of the
analysed structure that were used are shown in Appendix I. Specifically, concrete grade
C20/25 was used, with cubic compressive strength fck equal to 20MPa, and reinforcement
of yield tensile strength, fyk equal to 400MPa was used.
In the longitudinal direction:
Only the reinforcement on the longitudinal faces of the pier is included, as this was
assumed to be the critical reinforcement in the longitudinal direction. There is a clear cover
to the transverse reinforcement equal to 50mm. As shown above, the area of longitudinal

equal to 201mm2 per stirrup leg. The stirrups are placed along 150mm intervals.
As stated by Professor Priestley (1996) 50% of the corner bar areas are compressive or
tensile and the other 50% of the reinforcement is considered as side reinforcement.

A constant axial load, N equal to 8257kN was used; corresponding to the weight of the pier
and deck. As stated by Mergos (2004), it should be noted that this analysis is only valid for
a static, constant gravity load. If during a time history analysis the axial load changes, then
the corresponding yield moment also changes. In such a case this analysis is no longer
valid and requires a more refined analytical approach.
From the M-Ï† curve we get:

The moment of inertia of the pier section in the longitudinal direction was calculated:
ï‚· Ip = moment of inertia of pier (m4)
ï‚· B = width of pier section (m)
ï‚· D = depth of pier section (m)
= 4.4367 m4
Using the moment-curvature response (M-Ï†) conducted earlier; the effective moment of
inertia of the pier in the longitudinal direction was calculated by using the nominal yield of
the critical cross section in the longitudinal direction.
Since the gradient of the M-Ï† curve is equal to EI:
where:
ï‚· Ipeff = effective moment of inertia (m4)
ï‚· My = yield moment (kNm)
ï‚· E = Youngâ€™s elastic modulus (kN/m2)
ï‚· Ï†y = yield curvature (rad/m)

The effective area of the pier section was calculated by multiplying the pier section area
with the ratio of the former two moments of inertia calculated:
ï‚· Apeff = effective cross-sectional area of the pier (m2)
ï‚· Ap = cross-sectional area of the pier (m2)
= (5 * 2.2) * = 1.5196 m2
For simplicity, a bilinear M-Ï† curve was plotted using the two yield and ultimate points taken
from the original curve.

3.2 Linear Elastic Analysis
3.2.1 Introduction
A number of simplistic 2-dimensional linear elastic numerical models were created in order
to indicate some basic characteristics typically observed during foundation rocking and to
simply distinguish its particular effect on simple structures.
For the linear elastic analyses, the finite element analysis software SAP2000 was selected.
As stated before, only the longitudinal direction of the seismic excitation was analysed in
this investigation as it is the most crucial in seismic bridge design. Also it allows for a
simpler approach to the load simulation applied to the model. The deck mass can be
simulated as a point load acting at the head of the pier and thus the insertion of geometry,
reinforcement and material properties of the deck are not required. The use of this
assumption decreased the modeling duration and allowed for a simpler approach to the
problem.

Figure 3 - 5: The dimensions of the longitudinal
model completed are shown. The 2.5m deck height
is simulated as a continuous pier height and is
added to the total pier height, creating a 10m high
pier.
Figure 3 - 6: The seismic excitation is
modeled as a static horizontal load acting at
the head of the pier in the longitudinal
direction
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 22 - | P a g e
Three types of models of the bridge section were analysed under linear elastic static
loading conditions. The original bridge section model was broken down into three simpler
models which allowed for checking similar model types for consistency. This ensured that
the rocking isolation effects were made more identifiable and could be distinguished from
typical fixed base systems.
During the linear elastic modeling phase the loads acting on the model are:
ï‚· Dead load:
= Weight of Pier + Weight of Footing + Weight of Deck
ï‚· Earthquake load:
(*)
(*) This value does not represent the actual value of the seismic excitation. A load that
would produce relatively large and comparable horizontal deck displacements has been
imposed relative to the large weight of the structure. This way the results would be easily
distinguished.
A multi-degree-of-freedom-system was formed. The mass of the structure is broken down
into 7 lumped masses; the footing mass, M1; the pier frame is represented by M2, M3, M4
and M5; the deck mass, M6 and the mass moment of inertia, M7.

The weights of the lumped masses are calculated in Appendix II and their values are shown
below:

The mass moment of inertia of the footing was also calculated:
=
=2923.4 tm2
where:
ï‚· Im = mass moment of inertia of the structure (tm2)
ï‚· M1 = mass of the footing (kg)
ï‚· B =width of footing (m)
ï‚· D = depth of footing (m)
The mass moment of inertia accounts for rotation about the y-axis, which is the out of plane
axis.
All the models analysed are geometrically identical, however they differ on the restraining
conditions modelling the soil-structure interaction.
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project

3.2.2 Fixed Base Model
A geometrically identical model to the real-life analysed structure was created with the use
of SAP2000, which included identical reinforcement properties â€“sizes, spacing and material
steel properties for both the transverse and longitudinal reinforcement.
Hence the model has a fixed base; the node at the base of the pier has nodal restraints in
all 6 degrees of freedom. No foundation uplift is allowed.

shown here takes the soil-structure
interaction as fixed, restraining
translations or rotations in all
dimensions

3.2.3 Rotational Spring No Uplift Model
This model is identically the same to the fixed base model, but the support conditions now
change to allow foundation rocking. It should be noted that no uplift was included in this
model, meaning that during rocking the footing corners do not uplift above ground level. A
rotational spring was placed at the base of the footing at its centre of gravity which
simulated the soil-structure interaction and gave the footing the ability to rotate about the y-
axis.
Figure 3 - 11: The â€œRotational spring no upliftâ€ model shown here
simulates the soil-structure interaction by placing a rotational spring
at the base of the footing
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 27 - | P a g e
The footing was restrained from sliding during rocking hence the node at the base of the
footing was restrained for translation in the x and y-axes and for rotation about the x and z-
axes. This allowed for the observation of displacements in the x and z-axes and rotation
about the y-axis.
The rotational spring has stiffness, kÎ¸ and it assumes equal stiffness in both compression
and tension. This is not realistic since there is no tensile resistance to the footing from
uplifting during rocking.
The rotational spring stiffness, kÎ¸ was calculated using the following expression. It was
derived using first principles and can be found in Appendix III.
= 54675000 kNm/rad

3.2.4 Elastic Winkler No Uplift Model
The same footing-pier-deck system model was analysed here, however the method of
simulating the soil-structure interaction changed; it was now simulated using a Winkler
method. The Winkler method uses a number of translational nodal springs â€“ of zero length -
placed at regular intervals under the base of the footing in order to simulate the soil-
structure interaction. Like the previous rotational spring model, the footing was capable of
rocking.
This method produced similar results to the rotational spring model, however it was slightly
less accurate due to the increased number of elements used which increased the repeated
error.
Figure 3 - 13: The soil-structure interaction is modelled by placing a
sequence of translational springs at evenly spaced intervals along
the length of the base of the footing
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 29 - | P a g e
The model was named â€œElastic Winkler Model No Upliftâ€ and uses the same assumption as
in the rotational spring model; the underlying soil stiffness is equal in both tension and
compression. Two elastic Winkler models were created using SAP2000, one with constant
distance between the springs being 0.5m and the other with 0.25m. This was specifically
done to check for consistency between the models and to ensure that the spring stiffness
relationship used was consistent and could provide accurate results.
The individual spring stiffness, kÎ´ depends upon its position under the footing. The detailed
calculations of the stiffness for the various translational springs are shown in Appendix IV.
The expression is shown below:

3.3 Nonlinear Inelastic Analysis
3.3.1 Introduction
A 2-dimensional time-history analysis was conducted in order to observe the realistic
relationships and trends that form during rocking isolation. In order to achieve complete
results uplift was now included. For the inelastic dynamic analysis the finite element
analysis software Ruaumoko was used as it specialises in this particular type of analyses.
Three 2-dimensional models were created in Ruaumoko each with different footing
dimensions in planâ€“ 6mx6m, 9mx9m and 12mx12m â€“ however a constant distance between
springs of 0.5m was used in all models. This was done to distinguish the effect of the
footing dimensions on the footingâ€™s ability to isolate its superstructure through foundation
rocking.
The soil-structure interaction is now simulated by placing nonlinear inelastic Winkler nodal
springs â€“zero length-placed at even intervals along the length of the base of the footing.
These nonlinear springs have zero stiffness in tension and a stiffness value in compression
which is a function of the dimensions of the footing and the underlying soil stiffness, ksv.

The gradient of the lines in Figure 3 â€“ 15 (force/displacement) indicates the stiffness of the
springs. It is observed both from the calculations and the plot that the larger the dimensions
of the footing, the stiffer the structure becomes.
As in the linear elastic analysis, the same multi-degree of freedom system is used with 7
lumped masses accounting for the mass of the frame sections of the structure.
Contrary to the elastic modelling conducted where the seismic excitation was simply
modelled as a static 10 000kN Earthquake Load, the horizontal component of the 1995
Kobe excitation - as measured by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) - was
imposed on the structure. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) measured during the 1995
Kobe earthquake is found to be equal to 0.83375g and it occurs at T=5.06 sec. As Figure 3
- 16 shows the total duration of the earthquake is 50 seconds.

The yield strength, Ïƒy of the underlying soil in tension is taken to be zero and in
compression, Ïƒy =27MN/m2. This value was used in order to create an underlying soil that
would not yield during the analysis. This ensured that the analysis would indicate the
isolated seismic response of the structure affected solely by the complete effects of the
rocking isolation.
The viscous damping ratio, Î¾ for this model was taken to be equal to 5%.
3.3.2 Inelastic 6x6 Model
As in the elastic analysis, the structure modelled here includes only one footing-pier-deck
system. It has footing dimensions (plan view) of width and depth equal to 6m, all other
dimensions are identical to the real life structure.

4.1.1 Modal Analysis of Models That Exclude Uplift
The model used for the linear elastic analysis which excludes uplift is identical for both the
rotational spring and the two elastic Winkler models. It included 6 lumped masses plus the
mass moment of inertia of the structure. As a result 7 modes of vibration exist for the
structure in the longitudinal direction.
By observing the cumulative effective mass of the 7 modes, the most important natural
modes of vibration for the elastic 9x9 model in the longitudinal direction are shown below:

It was observed that the 9x9 model that included uplift and the model that excluded uplift
had very similar modal periods. This was due to the models having the same footing
dimensions thus same initial spring stiffness. The model that excluded uplift had slightly
smaller modal periods than the 9x9 that included uplift as was expected since the footing
could rock but not uplift; the translational springs had stiffness in tension as well as in
compression.

It should be noted that due to the fact that the mass moment of inertia was included, all 7
modes of vibration were required to cover the total mass of the structure. It was also
observed that for the models that include uplift, the modal period decreases proportionally
with the increase of the footing size, which may be due to the footingâ€™s increased weight
and stiffness.

By comparison we can see that the fixed base model had the smallest deck displacements
and rotations. This is what was expected initially and will be used as a benchmark for
comparison of the effects of the rocking that is allowed in the other linear elastic models.
The other three models have similar results in displacements with displacements in the x-
axis with a range of: 0.2 mm â‰¤ Î´x â‰¤ 3.1 mm,
Displacements in the z-axis: Î´z = 0.4mm,
Rotation about the y-axis: 2 x 10-5 rad â‰¤ Î¸y â‰¤ 4.2 x 10-4 rad.
It is observed that the last two Elastic Winkler Models that exclude uplift have a result
inconsistency of Î´x= 0.2 mm and Î¸y = 2 x 10-5 rad, which accounts for 0.26% and 0.23%
respectively. Since the result discrepancy is less than 0.5%, the models are assumed to be
consistent.
The fixed base restraint allowed for smaller deck displacements and rotations however the
curvature demand of the pier increased significantly which can be seen from the curving
shape of the pier in Figure 4 - 5.

Base model.

The spring at the base of the footing of the Rotational Spring Model and the translational
springs under the base of the footing in the Elastic Winkler Models gave the footing the
ability to rock on its axis, creating larger horizontal deck displacements and rotations but
keeping the curvature demands of the pier to much lower levels than when comparing to
the fixed base model.
4.3 Nonlinear Inelastic Analysis Results
The results of the three inelastic models subjected to the JMA horizontal ground
accelerations of the 1995 Kobe Earthquake in the longitudinal direction are shown here.

It was observed that the 12x12 model had the smallest deck displacements with a
maximum of 0.412m in the negative direction at 5.32sec, while the largest were for the 6x6
model with a maximum of 0.609m in the positive direction at 7.385sec. The 9x9 model had
a maximum deck displacement of 0.539m in the negative direction at 7.73 seconds.
This was expected since as seen in the modal analysis, the larger the footing size the
smaller the magnitude of foundation rocking.
It may also be observed that the only model that did not fail during the earthquake was the
6x6 model as it showed an elastic response throughout the excitation and had no residual
displacement. The 9x9 and 12x12 models suffered a residual deck displacement of
0.0196m in the negative direction and 0.0402m in the positive direction respectively.
Next, the moment-rotation relationships for the three models at the base of the pier are
shown.

It was observed that the 12x12 modelâ€™s response is very similar to that of a fixed base
model; there is a near linear M-Î¸ relationship at the base of the pier with very small rotation
responding to the applied moment. The other two models however showed eminent signs
of foundation rocking and an energy dissipation trend. The 9x9 model showed large
rotations up to â‰ˆ0.026rad responding to the same maximum moment value of â‰ˆ51800kNm
as in the 12x12. The essential effect of the foundation rocking was shown in the 6x6 model
where the pier base moment was significantly decreased to â‰ˆ34100kNm at the same
maximum rotation. This shows a relationship between foundation rocking and a decrease in
moment capacity.
Next the vertical displacement of the left corner spring of the footing of the three inelastic
models is presented below. This corresponds to the magnitude of uplift in each model.

12x12 0.0074 0.0032
Table 4 - 6: Maximum uplift and vertical settlement of the footing corner
It can be said that the 12x12 model behaved very similar to a fixed base model with minimal
foundation rocking. On the contrary the other two models show significant signs of
foundation rocking. The 6x6 and 9x9 models behave very similarly with respect to uplift;
their difference of +0.004m can be considered negligible and can be justified as an error
caused by the constant distance of 0.5m between springs. A more refined mesh would
reduce the error. It is also observed that the smaller the footing size the larger the pounding
force impacting the underlying soil, as seen by the increasing trend of negative vertical
displacements with the decrease of the footing size.
It should be noted however that since the underlying soil is elastic there is no permanent
settlement, as seen in Figure 4 - 10 the vertical displacement is zero at the end of the
excitation.

Next the hysteresis loops observed at the base of the pier are presented.
It was observed here that the footing size is directly proportional to the curvature demands
observed in the pier. The larger the footing size, the larger the curvature in the pier. There
is a big difference - with respect to the curvature demands created in the pier - between the
12x12 model and the two models (6x6 and 9x9) that showed signs of foundation rocking
and the 12x12 model. The 12x12 model has a maximum curvature value of 0.0233rad/m
which translates to a rotation of 0.233rad at the deck. On the other hand the 6x6 and 9x9
models have maximum curvature values of and 0.0022rad/m 0.0065rad/m which translate
into rotations at the deck of 0.022rad and 0.065rad respectively.

CHAPTER 5 â€“ PARAMETRIC STUDY
5.1 Introduction
The influences of the footing dimensions and the underlying soil stiffness on the foundation
rocking capacity of a structure are examined here. For this parametric investigation use of
theory and static equilibrium principles were made in order to determine expressions
relating the various parameters involved. The detailed derivation of these expressions is
shown in Appendix VI.
5.2 Footing Dimensions
Here the influence of the footing size on the magnitude of the foundation rocking is
examined. This is achieved by selecting various square dimensions for the footing and
performing analytical calculations for those sizes and observing any differences. It should
be noted that the pier geometry and material properties remain unchanged in the structure.
Three footing sizes were examined: 6x6, 9x9 and 12x12.
1. The effect of the size of the footing on the rotational stiffness that excludes uplift
was first examined.
The footing dimensions are proportional to the rotational stiffness. Hence:
Footing Size (m) 6x6 9x9 12x12
Rotational Stiffness, kÎ¸
(kNm/rad)
10.8*106 54.675*106 172.8*106
Table 5 - 1: Rotational stiffness for various footing sizes
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 51 - | P a g e
2. Examining now the effect of footing size on models that include uplift. As shown
previously, the expression used to calculate the stiffness of the translational springs used to
model uplift is:
kÎ´ = ksv * B * L
Again we see that the translational spring stiffness is linearly proportional to the footing
dimensions. The distance between springs in the models is kept constant and equal to
0.5m.
Footing Size (m) 6x6 9x9 12x12
Translational Spring
Stiffness, kÎ´ (kN/m)
300000 450000 600000
Table 5 - 2: Translational spring stiffness for various footing sizes
Clearly the larger the footing the larger the rotational stiffness and hence the lower the
ability to rock. Also by increasing the dimensions of the footing, the weight of the footing is
increased which consequently increases the axial load on the structure. Increasing the axial
load decreases the footingâ€™s ability to rock.

Furthermore, the ductility of the pier with respect to the total rotation of the structure is
presented below.
From this figure it is observed that the larger the footing size the lower the tolerance to
rotation. The 6x6 footing shows a large tolerance to rotation reaching its elastic ductility
(Î¼Î¸=1) beyond a total rotation, Î¸t of 0.03rad which is the maximum rotation the structure can
take without suffering flexural failure. Thus the 6x6 footing ensures the pier will not endure
flexural failure in a seismic excitation. By observing the other two models, the larger the
footing size the less rotational tolerance the pier can take before enduring flexural failure.

From these figures it was observed that the larger the footing the larger the moment
induced onto the pier under the same rotation. However as the footing size increases, the
yield moment, My and ultimate moment, Mu increase and the yield rotation, Î¸y decreases.
5.3 The Stiffness of the Underlying Soil
Moreover the effect of variations in the stiffness of the underlying soil, ksv on the foundation
rocking capacity is examined here. The same expressions are used here as with the footing
size investigation. All expressions are shown in Appendix V.
This investigation uses the following values for ksv:
kSV = (50000, 100000, 150000, 200000) kN/m3
Figure 5 â€“ 4 shows that variations in the underlying soil stiffness do not affect significantly
the behaviour of the pier. The ductility of the pier does not change greatly; however the
rotation of the structure at which the pier will endure damage decreases proportionally with
the increase in soil stiffness

As it can be seen from the two figures above, the moment capacity of the pier is not
significantly affected by variations in the stiffness of the underlying soil. Only when the
stiffness falls below 100000kN/m3 (ksv = 50000kN/m3) there is a slight decrease in the
ultimate moment the structure can take. The rest of the ksv values (100000-200000kN/m3)
do not present great differences in the moment capacity.

CHAPTER 6 â€“ COMPARISON BETWEEN THEORY AND
NUMERICAL MODELLING RESULTS
6.1 Introduction
An analytical moment-rotation analysis (M-Î¸) based on theory was conducted to derive
expressions and numerical results which were then compared to the results derived from
the numerical modelling.
6.2 Theoretical Derivation of Expressions
Analytical M-Î¸ relationships both for footings including and excluding uplift were derived
using static equilibrium principles and are shown in detail in Appendix VI.
1. For the footing excluding uplift the following expression was derived:
where:
ï‚· Î¸ = rotation (rad/m)
ï‚· M = footing moment excluding uplift (kNm)
ï‚· B = footing width (m)
ï‚· L = footing length (m)
ï‚· ksv = underlying soil stiffness (kN/m3)
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 59 - | P a g e
The critical moment:
where:
ï‚· Mcr = critical moment at which the footing uplifts (kNm)
ï‚· N = axial force (kN)
The critical rotation:
where:
ï‚· Î¸cr = critical rotation at the footing uplifts (rad/m)
2. For the footing including uplift:
All constants have been previously defined
Using these expressions a comparison was made between the analytical results and the
numerical results produced by Ruaumoko.

Presented below are the moment-rotation relationships produced.
The two curves are not exactly the same but follow a similar trend. The inconsistency of the
numerical analysis results may be due to the fact that a finite number of springs were used
in Ruaumoko; a constant distance between the springs of 0.5m was used. The solution to
this could be a more refined or dense mesh to reduce to inconsistencies between theory
and numerical analysis. Also the asymmetric loading of the seismic excitation is another
reason for the discrepancies observed in the yielding behaviour of the structure, while the
theoretical response takes an approximately bilinear increase of moment into account.

6.3 Derivation of Maximum Horizontal Displacements Using
Theoretical Horizontal Elastic Spectral Analysis
A horizontal elastic spectral analysis using Eurocode 8 Part 1:2004 was used to determine
the maximum horizontal displacements under the longitudinal horizontal component of the
JMA observatory 1995 Kobe seismic excitation that was imposed. The detailed calculations
and expressions used are included in Appendix VII.
The Type 1 elastic spectrum was chosen due to the high seismicity of an area such as
Japan. A viscous damping ratio, Î¾ equal to 5% was used and hence a damping correction
factor, Î· equal to 1 was used. The ground was taken to be of type B since the sand in which
the footings were constructed in has a NSPT value of more than 50. Since an elastic
response is to be determined, a factor of safety, Î³ equal to 1 was used. Lastly, the peak
horizontal ground acceleration (PGA) was taken to be 0.83375g.
Presented below are the results.
Maximum Horizontal Displacements (m)
Footing Size (m) Theoretical Ruaumoko
6x6 0.2793m 0.6090m
9x9 0.1845m 0.5410m
12x12 0.0947m 0.4120m
Table 6 - 1: Maximum horizontal displacements from theory and Ruaumoko
It was observed that the results of the two methods are not very consistent, they are
approximately in the same of order of magnitude however they differ significantly. This may
be due to the fact that the finite element mesh created in Ruaumoko was not very refined;
the springs had a constant distance of 0.5m between them. A more refined mesh might
reduce the inconsistency.

CHAPTER 7 â€“ CONCLUSIONS
At this point given the post-processing of the numerical and analytical results obtained, a
number of deductions were made.
It was observed that the size of the footing significantly affects the rocking capability of the
footing. By looking at the theoretical expressions derived for footing uplift, it can be stated
that the moment capacity is a function of the axial load and the footingâ€™s length. Thus, by
increasing the size of the footing the moment capacity of the pier is increased. This in
essence decreases the ductility demand of the pier hence the pierâ€™s damage potential
increases. Furthermore by increasing the moment capacity, the magnitude of foundation
rocking is decreased which decreases deck displacements.
It was also noted that the stiffness of the underlying soil affects the foundation rocking
capability of the pier. An increase in the underlying soil stiffness causes a decrease in the
footing uplift due to the lower elasticity of the ground. It should be noted that the underlying
soil stiffness affects the rocking isolation on a smaller scale when compared to the effect of
the footing size. It can be concluded that in very stiff foundation soils, footing uplift may be
negligible.
Through the analytical and numerical results it is clear that foundation rocking has an
isolation effect; proven to be beneficial by dissipating energy and reducing potential
damage to the pier. Ductility demands and curvature demands are increased and
decreased respectively. However, foundation rocking has the ability to jeopardise this
benefit due to its potential to cause damage to the pier. This would be caused by the
pounding of the footing on the underlying soil during rocking. Especially at the footing
corners â€“ where the highest vertical accelerations are developedâ€“ the magnitude of the
City University London Master of Engineering Major Project
- 63 - | P a g e
impacts of the footing with the soil can significantly increase the axial load and hence the
moment capacity of the footing.
With regards to elastic and inelastic Winkler models one can conclude that the
computational effort required is quite high, especially if refined finite element meshes are
incorporated into models to increase accuracy. An alternative modelling solution - as seen
in the linear elastic modelling- is to use a rotational spring at the base of the footing in which
the effect of uplift may be easily incorporated. This significantly decreases the
computational effort.
This paper only focused on the uniaxial component of the seismic excitation. Further work
could include biaxial and triaxial excitation components to analyse the effects of rocking
more accurately.
It can be concluded that foundation rocking is a beneficial response mechanism to seismic
excitations, as it minimises the potential for damage. However it can jeopardise the
serviceability of the structure due to the high velocity impacts of the footing with the soil
during uplift.

- 71 - | P a g e
We know that the stress experienced by the underlying soil:
Ïƒ = ksv * Î”
where ksv = elastic modulus of underlying soil (stiffness in compression)( kN/m3)
Thus since the footing is modelled in only two dimensions:
Force = stress * applied area
= Ïƒ * B * 1
= ksv * B * Î”
= ksv * B * L/2
Taking the Right Hand Side of the point of rotation of the footing:
Î£F = Â½ * (L/2) * F
= L/4 * F
= L/4 * ksv * B * L/2
= L2/8 * ksv * B
As found previously, the maximum moment occurs at a lever arm at a distance :
M =
= L2/8 * ksv x B
= ksv * BL3/12

Since as found previously, M = kÎ¸:
Hence:
kÎ¸ = ksv x BL3/12
ï‚· ksv =stiffness of underlying soil (kN/m3) = 100000 kN/m3
Hence the stiffness of the rotational spring used to model the soil-structure interaction:

where:
ï‚· Ïƒ2 = stress at right hand footing corner (kN/m2)
ï‚· Ïƒ1 = stress at left hand footing corner (kN/m2)

All other constants have been previously defined.
Here the moment, M is created by the the trapezoidal shape of the stresses, Ïƒ1 and Ïƒ2 in
the underlying stresses created by the rotation of the structure, which in turn cause vertical
displacements, v1 and v2.
Hence finding the stresses:
Ïƒ1 = ksv * v1 (3)
Ïƒ2 = ksv * v2 (4)
For rigid foundations we may use the following relationship:
v2-v1 = Î¸ * L (5)
where:
ï‚· Î¸ = rotation (rad/m)
Hence combining the above relationships:
Ïƒ2 â€“ Ïƒ1 = ksv (v2 - v1)
= ksv * (Î¸ * L) (6)
