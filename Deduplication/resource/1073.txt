I Will be talking about my Concept art production and explaining
the tools I used and why I used it for.
First Step
This my sketch of my item I have scanned
my sketch item to the library then I
scanned it to my email. Then I opened
pixlr and was thinking about the idea of
my work
Second Step
This is my second draft of my concept I have used
yellow, orange and Red because these colours are
bight and useful to my item. The Tools I used was
The pencil to outline my item. The other tools I
used was Bucket Tool because to the filter the
piece as you can see above I added red to show
what colour filter I used for my item. I also used
The rubber to get rid of any colours which gets
mixed with other colours.
Last step
This is my last piece of my item which
outlines what changes I done to this then
the second step. I added a light yellow
for my middle part of my item because
you can see that its bright enough but
with dark yellow it wouldn't be suitable.
Also I added a light yellow to my piece of
item next to the red filter. The tools I
used for this was Bucket tool, Pencil and
a Brush because it helps my item look
better and more professional
