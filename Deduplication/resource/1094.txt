Inventory Specification modules integrate with Accounts
Receivable to create a complete order entry, customer returns,
billing and receivables system that delivers superior customer and
inventory management.
Bank Reconciliation
Keeping an accurate tab on your cash flow is an essential part of
managing your business and AccountMateâ€™s Bank Reconciliation
module makes it a breeze. With this module, you can record
miscellaneous disbursements, receipts and bank transfers that are
not logged in other AccountMate modules. You can indicate which
transactions have cleared the bank and reconcile your book
entries with the bank statements. You can set up and update bank
accounts and specify the currency in which transactions will be
recorded for each one. You can quickly view your current bank
account balance, the last reconciled bank statement balance and
the total amount of unreconciled bank transactions. This keeps
you well informed of your companyâ€™s real-time cash position.
Business Alerts
Licensed Users can use the many predefined alerts to send
emails to specific individuals or groups that need to be aware of a
situation that has just occurred or a reminder to take some action.
These email alerts can be administered to send an alert to one
specific person or to a specified group of people. No longer do
people have to read reports and manually send off an email.
Proper alerts can be scheduled by an Administrator who names
the appropriate addressee and when a condition is met, emails
are sent automatically.
There are currently 32 predefined alerts that come standard in the
Alert Manager for AccountMate module.

Gain real-time insight and discover trends in your business
performance by using AccountMate Business Analysis. Anyone

Custom fields of any type can be assigned a default value while
character-type custom fields can have a lookup which can be used
to validate data and locate records. The ability to add custom

detail per line item. You can also accrue landed costs and allocate
them to purchased items. When creating purchase orders, you
have a plethora of information about each inventory item at your
fingertip which helps you select the right item every time. You get
to define which items are for resale and which ones are solely for
in-house use. And when your Purchase Order system is integrated
