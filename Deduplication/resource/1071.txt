What is Global Warming?
An increase in the average temperature of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere
and oceans
Global temperature on both
land and sea increased by
0.6 Â± 0.2 Â°C over the past
century
Volume of atmospheric
carbon dioxide increased
from 280 parts per
million in 1800 to 367 in
2000, a 31% increase
over 200 years
Our Changing Climate
ï‚­ The snow cover in the
Northern Hemisphere and
floating ice in the Arctic
Ocean have decreased
ï‚­ Sea level has risen 4-8
inches over the past
century
ï‚­ Global surface temp. could
rise 1-4.5Â°F (0.6-2.5Â°C) in
the next fifty years, and
2.2-10Â°F (1.4-5.8Â°C) in the
next century
ï‚­ Global mean surface temperatures have increased 0.5-1.0Â°F
since the late 19th century
What causes it?
Human Impacts-
Atmospheric greenhouse gases
trap some of the outgoing
energy, retaining heat
Since industrial revolution, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increased 30%,
methane more than doubled, nitrous oxide risen by 15%.
These increases have enhanced the heat-trapping capability of the earthâ€™s atmosphere
Greenhouse Gases -
CO2 Methane Nitrous oxide Fluorinated compounds
Natural Impacts-
Change in sunâ€™s energy output
Volcanoes Water Vapor Clouds
Greenhouse Gas
Emissions
ï‚­ Animal agriculture, manure,
natural gas, rice paddies,
landfills, coal, and other
anthropogenic sources
contribute about 450
million tons of methane
each year
ï‚­ Atmospheric
concentrations of CO2 and
CH4 have increased by 31%
and 149% respectively
above pre-industrial levels
since 1750
ï‚­ Combustion of fossil fuelsïƒ  coal-burning power plants,
automobile exhausts, factory smokestacks, other waste vents
of the human environment contribute 22 billion tons of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases each year
Greenhouse Gas
Emissions
Power Plants
40% of carbon dioxide emissions stem from the burning of fossil fuels for the purpose of
electricity generation
Cars
20% of carbon dioxide emissions comes from the burning of gasoline in internal-
combustion engines of cars and light trucks with poor gas mileage contribute the most to
global warming
Trucks
Another 13% of carbon dioxide emissions come from
trucks used mostly for commercial purposes
Airplanes
Aviation causes 3.5 percent of global warming,
and the figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050
Carbon Dioxide from Buildings
Buildings structure account for about 12% of
carbon dioxide emissions
Greenhouse Gas
Emissions
Methane
â€¢ Methane is more than 20 times as effective as CO2 at trapping heat in the
atmosphere
â€¢ 2004 Levels of atmospheric methane have risen 145% in the last 100 years
â€¢ Derived from sources such as rice paddies, bovine
flatulence, bacteria in bogs and fossil fuel
production
â€¢ In flooded fields, anaerobic conditions develop
and the organic matter in the soil decomposes
Nitrous oxide
â€¢ Naturally produced by oceans and rainforests
â€¢ Man-made sources-nylon and nitric acid
production, the use of fertilizers in agriculture,
cars with catalytic converters and the burning
of organic matter
Deforestation
â€¢ Responsible for 25% of all carbon emissions
entering the atmosphere by the burning and cutting of about 34 million acres of
trees each year
The Carbon Cycle
Effects of Global
Warming
Negative Effects
Rising Sea Level
Change of precipitation and local climate
conditions; acid rain
Alteration of forests and crop yields
Expansions of deserts into existing rangelands
More intense rainstorms
Destabilization of Ocean currents
Positive Effects
Can stimulate plant growth in places where CO2 and temperature are the limiting
factors (preventing photorespiration which can destroy existing sugars)
Melting Arctic ice may open the Northwest Passage in summer, which would cut
5,000 nautical miles from shipping routes between Europe and Asia
What Can be Done:
AlternativesRenewable Energy Sources
Solar Energies Wind Power Biomass Geothermal
Changes In Vehicle Systems
Hybrid Fuel Cell Battery-
Electric
Kyoto Protocol
ï‚­ 1997, Kyoto, Japan ïƒ  developed countries
agreed to specific targets for cutting their
emissions of greenhouse gases
ï‚­ Industrialized countries committed to an
overall reduction of emissions of greenhouse
gases to 5.2% below 1990 levels for the period
2008 - 2012
ï‚­ Objective is the stabilization of greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
would prevent dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate system
Conclusion
ï‚­ Global Change is multifaceted (climate, nitrogen, land use, invasive,
biodiversity, air quality, etc.)
ï‚­ The greenhouse effect is a natural process which is necessary to
maintain living conditions on the planet
ï‚­ However, the natural planetary greenhouse effect has been
augmented by human activities, including primarily fossil fuel use
and deforestation.
ï‚­ Responsibility to improve environmental conditions lies upon all of
us as individuals
ï‚­ Concentrate on preventing environmental degradation before it
starts
ï‚­ Alternatives are feasible and can be used
