Katja Hall
foreword
Employers know that there is no more important issue facing our
economy than getting the education and skills system right â€“ it is
crucial to cementing recent improvements in growth sustainably
over the longer term. Itâ€™s essential we build the right skills base if
weâ€™re to support a rebalancing towards those high-value, high-skill
activities that will underpin our role in the global marketplace.
The CBIâ€™s First Steps report set out the business
priorities for education. Our focus must be on striving
to develop rigorous, rounded and grounded young
people that are better prepared to succeed and
better able to help businesses thrive. The Education
and Skills survey year on year reflects this analysis:
employers rate attitudes and aptitudes in school and
college leavers as their top priority. Weâ€™ve started to
see progress but thereâ€™s no doubt weâ€™re only a short
way along this path to successful reform.
The 2014 edition shows that business is clear that
we must keep up the push for progress. Reform of
the education system needs to clearly set out what
we want our schools to deliver â€“ young people with
not only knowledge and skills but also with the
characteristics and behaviours that set them up for
success in life and work â€“ and effectively hold schools
to account against this. Weâ€™ve got to make sure that
all young people receive an education that will enable
them to fulfil their potential â€“ in every school across
the UK, whatever the area and whoever is in charge.
This yearâ€™s survey also shows us that many
businesses remain concerned about the challenges
they have with filling the roles of the future that
will require more high-skilled employees. Beyond
schools, a more responsive and demand-led system
of skills development is needed to overcome this.
The increased take up of advanced and higher
apprenticeships and commitment to funding training
at higher levels is a promising development, but itâ€™s
also vital that this doesnâ€™t result in a continued drop-
off in numbers undertaking apprenticeships at an
intermediate level.
Employers want to play a bigger part too. There have
been encouraging steps taken to move towards the
employer-driven skills system we need, but increased
business engagement in schools can add even more
value to the school environment â€“ from engagement
within careers guidance and professionals
volunteering as governors, to sponsoring academies
and supporting curriculum development related
to their industry. Business is already doing a lot to
support young people in this way â€“ but there is real
potential to scale this up for the benefit of all. A local
system of brokerage to support these links could be
of significant value.
Itâ€™s obvious that it will take time before the full effects
of the reforms seen over the last 12 months take hold.
But in the meantime, we must continue the journey
of reform to make sure we support the development
of the skills, knowledge and people that will enable
British businesses to grow and compete now and in
the future.

foreword
Mark Anderson, Pearson
Young people in our country are trying to adapt to a fast
changing world, full of new opportunities but also facing a tough
economic climate and a fight for jobs. Last year we spoke to over
8,000 learners in our My Education census, and we heard from
an ambitious generation who know it will be challenging to find
work. They sent a clear message: they wanted to develop more of
the skills required to succeed in the workplace.
Conversely, we know through our work with the CBI
on this survey in recent years that employers are
regularly voicing concern over the job readiness of too
many young people. This is echoed by voices in higher
education, who feel that many incoming students lack
some of the qualities they will need to succeed.
Adding to this backdrop â€“ and in order to rejuvenate
our economy so we remain competitive against the
levels of academic and technical prowess of young
people in other countries â€“ significant reforms are
being made in education.
I want Pearson to be one of the companies that
helps to bring these complementary demands and
changes together. We agree that young people should
receive more of the skills, know-how and support
they crave as they contemplate their future career;
as an employer we think itâ€™s important that the young
people we recruit have the skills we need if we are
to continue to succeed; and as a global education
company we understand the need to reform education
to meet the challenges posed by globalisation and
rapid technological advances.
Critical to meeting these challenges will be the vital
role that apprenticeships and vocational qualifications
like Pearsonâ€™s BTEC can play in ensuring we have the
highly-skilled and versatile workforce we will need in
the future.
BTECs are currently being reformed to meet the
needs of future employee and employer alike, and the
reforms we are making are informed by the advice
and guidance of a panel of international education
and employment experts, under our world class
qualification programme. We are determined that
BTEC represents valuable, stretching and engaging
learning, enabling progression into the next stage
of education or into a good job. And what is more,
through our work on the efficacy of our products and
services, we are committed to collecting the data and
evidence that will enable us to prove the progress
that learners make through BTEC.
It is particularly encouraging that the report
confirms the upward trend in employers involved
in apprenticeships, with two thirds of those offering
apprenticeships planning to extend their programmes
in future. When we look at best practice around
the world (in places like Australia, Denmark,
Germany, Singapore, and Switzerland) the common
denominator is that they have well-developed national
vocational systems. Apprenticeships cannot be some
kind of â€œlast resortâ€ but rather a strong potential
choice from early secondary school â€“ and part of a
range of options that keep choices and opportunities
open. We strongly welcome the commitment made in
the UK to Apprenticeships.
This report underlines the demand for a much greater
focus on improved vocational learning. Employers and
learners alike demand nothing less.

6 Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Executive summary
The education and skills landscape in 2014
â€¢	 The recovery continues to advance, with stronger
growth and higher levels of employment than seen
in recent years â€“ however improved education
and skills are needed to secure these positive
developments.
â€¢	 Too many young people are still leaving school
without the core of literacy and numeracy they
need to be successful in life and work â€“ with 36.4%
not achieving a C in GCSE English and 42.4% not
reaching this standard in maths.
â€¢	 The UKâ€™s position in international education rankings
has stagnated, highlighting the need for action.
â€¢	 Whilst youth unemployment levels have improved
over the last 12 months, they remain high, and
we must ensure the right structures are in place
to support young people in their transitions from
school.
â€¢	 Employers continue to support staff through
training and development, but it is crucial that
skills being developed reflect the needs of the
labour market.
The seventh education and skills survey
â€¢	 The CBI/Pearson education and skills survey was
conducted in the spring of 2014
â€¢	 Usable responses were received from 291
employers, collectively employing more than 1.4
million people. Participant organisations are drawn
from all sectors of the economy and are of all sizes
The recovery faces a mounting risk of skill
shortages	
â€¢	 Most employers consider overall skill levels
among their employees have been satisfactory
for their functions to date, with more than two
thirds (69%) rating the skills of their high-skilled
employees as good
â€¢	 But more than half of employers are aware of
weaknesses in the core competencies of at
least some of their employees in literacy (54%),
numeracy (53%) and IT skills (61%)
â€¢	 The drive towards a higher-skill economy means
that over the next three to five years, far more
businesses expect to increase the number of jobs
requiring leadership and management skills and
higher skills than expect to reduce them (positive
balances of +73% and +71% respectively)
â€¢	 Almost as many employers expect to decrease
the number of low-skilled employees in the next
few years as to increase the number (producing a
small positive balance of +5%), meaning there will
be tough competition for jobs among those with
lower skill levels
â€¢	 Demand for more people with higher-level skills
is expected to be particularly strong in sectors
central to growth such as engineering (+95%),
manufacturing (+76%) and construction (+69%)
â€¢	 Growing numbers of businesses are worried there
will not be sufficient skilled people to meet this
rising demand as the economic recovery gains
pace (with a balance of -23% not confident they
will be able to fill all their higher-skills roles)
â€¢	 The confidence deficit on the availability of enough
people with the right high-level skills applies
across firms of all sizes, in all nations of the UK
and all major sectors.
7Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
STEM skills in short supply	
â€¢	 Nearly two in five firms (39%) that need employees
with STEM skills and knowledge currently have
difficulties recruiting staff at some level and over
half (53%) expect problems in the next three years
â€¢	 Shortages of STEM-qualified technicians are
particularly widespread, with more than a quarter
(28%) of firms in STEM-based sectors reporting
current difficulties in recruitment and more than
a third (35%) anticipating problems over the next
three years
â€¢	 Shortages of STEM graduates are also starting
to be experienced (by 19%) and are expected to
affect many more STEM-based firms (28%) in the
coming years
â€¢	 Difficulties in recruiting people with STEM skills
are expected to be most severe in the construction
sector as major new projects get under way, with
firms anticipating problems in the next three years
in finding technicians (48%), graduate recruits (37%)
and suitable people to train as apprentices (36%)
â€¢	 Businesses have concerns about both the quality
(48%) and quantity (46%) of STEM graduates,
and report that too many lack general workplace
experience (39%)
â€¢	 To fire interest among young people in studying
STEM subjects and pursuing STEM careers,
businesses recognise that they have a key role in
engaging with schools (57%) and offering more
STEM-based apprenticeships (57%). They also see
the need to work with universities to ensure the
business-relevance of courses (54%)
â€¢	 There is a critically important role for government
in ensuring there is an adequate supply of
specialist science and maths teachers in
schools to equip young people with knowledge
and enthusiasm for STEM (cited by 50% of
respondents).
Businesses are stepping up skills
investment	
â€¢	 Far more firms plan to increase their investment
in employee training and development during the
coming year than plan to cut back (producing a
positive balance of +26%)
â€¢	 The positive balance of firms planning increased
investment over those planning reductions is
particularly strong in construction at +44%,
reflecting recognition of the need to tackle skill
shortages
â€¢	 Businesses are having to divert some of their
training investment to tackle weaknesses in basic
skills of numeracy, literacy and IT competence,
with nearly half of employers (44%) saying they
have organised training in at least one basic skill
area in the past year for adult employees and more
than a quarter (28%) for some young people joining
from school or college
â€¢	 Most businesses rely on external training partners
to at least some extent, with 49% of training on
average delivered by external providers
â€¢	 While private providers lead on every satisfaction
measure, the great majority of businesses give a
positive rating too to FE colleges and universities
on essential issues such as the quality of trainers
and the relevance of course content to skill and
business needs
â€¢	 To drive forward employer ownership of the skills
agenda, basing qualification design on employer
needs and industry standards is cited as among
the leading priorities by more than four in five
business (84%) and as the single most important
one by over half (54%).
8 Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Executive summary
Shaping a fully effective apprenticeship
system	
â€¢	 The proportion of employers involved in
apprenticeships has risen to more than two thirds
of our survey in the past two years (69% in 2013
and 68% in 2014) from only half (51%) in 2009
â€¢	 Two thirds of those offering apprenticeships (69%)
plan to extend their programmes in future while
across all respondents one in eight (13%) plans to
start offering apprenticeships in the next three years
â€¢	 Provision of apprenticeships is spreading into new
sectors such professional services (where 42% of
businesses now have at least some apprentices)
â€¢	 Leading priorities for action to encourage
expansion in apprenticeship programmes include
more relevant qualification programmes (44%),
giving firms greater purchasing power by routing
the apprenticeship grant directly to employers
(34%) and reducing bureaucracy (31%)
â€¢	 Greater simplification and streamlining of the
system and action by schools to prepare young
people would encourage increased provision by
SMEs â€“ currently half of SMEs have no apprentices
compared to less than one on ten (8%) firms with
over 5,000 employees.
Raising the performance of our schools
â€¢	 Businesses are becoming concerned about the
increasing educational divergence between
different UK nations: two thirds (67%) believe
it is important that qualifications are directly
comparable and readily understood by employers
â€¢	 Levels of awareness about the new vocational
qualifications are very low among businesses, with
85% knowing little or nothing about them.
â€¢	 The most important factors employers weigh up
when recruiting school and college leavers are their
attitudes to work (85%), their general aptitudes
(63%) and literacy and numeracy (44%). These rank
well ahead of formal academic results (38%)
â€¢	 Many businesses are not satisfied with the
attitudes and skills of school leavers in important
areas including attitudes to work (33%), teamwork
(36%), basic numeracy (38%), problem solving
(50%) and communication skills (52%)
â€¢	 Businesses want to see primary schools
concentrating above all on developing pupilsâ€™
literacy and numeracy (85%), with these also as
the most commonly cited priority (by 62%) in the
11-14 phase of schooling
â€¢	 For the 14-19 age group, employers believe the
top priority for schools and colleges should be
developing awareness of working life with support
from businesses (52%)
â€¢	 	Almost two thirds of businesses (65%) value
foreign language skills among their employees,
particularly in helping build relations with clients,
customers and suppliers (28%)
â€¢	 French (50%) and German (49%) are the leading
languages in demand by firms, but those geared to
business in China are increasingly seen as useful
(with those valuing knowledge of Mandarin up
from 25% in 2012 to 31% in 2014).
Businesses recognise the need to support
schools	
â€¢	 Eight out of ten businesses (80%) now have links of
some type with at least one school or college
â€¢	 Over the past year, the balance of firms increasing
their links with schools and colleges over those
reducing them has climbed to +51%
â€¢	 While two thirds of businesses have links with
secondary schools (64%) and FE colleges (63%),
only a third (31%) have links to primaries
â€¢	 Among employers with links to schools and
colleges, the most common forms of support are
offering work experience placements (77%) and
providing careers advice and talks (67%)
â€¢	 Other widespread forms of business support
include involvement in schemes to promote study
of particular subjects (36%), employees acting as
governors (32%) and employees becoming student
mentors (31%)
9Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
â€¢	 Progress is slow on tackling barriers to business
involvement, with widespread uncertainty over
how to make work experience worthwhile (31%),
lack of interest among schools or pupils (19%) and
problems in fitting involvement with the school
timetable (19%)
Careers advice: not yet fit for purpose	
â€¢	 The great majority of employers believe the quality
of careers advice for young people is not good
enough (by a balance of -77%)
â€¢	 The quality of careers advice young people receive
to help them make informed decisions about future
options in education is also seen as inadequate (by
a balance of -44%)
â€¢	 These weaknesses in careers advice are reported
by a large majority of businesses in every part of
the UK
â€¢	 There is a readiness among employers to play a
greater role in delivering careers advice, with two
thirds (66%) willing to do more
â€¢	 Short-term work placements of a week or two are
by far the most common type of work experience
offered by businesses (89%), but almost half (46%)
also offer longer-term paid internships.
Developing the right skills in graduates
â€¢	 Many more businesses have increased their
graduate recruitment in the past year than have
cut back, with a positive balance of +18% taking on
more graduate recruits
â€¢	 Businesses are looking first and foremost for
graduates with the attitudes and aptitudes that
will enable them to be effective in the workplace
â€“ nearly nine in ten employers (89%) value these
above other factors such as degree subject (68%)
â€¢	 Traditional graduate recruitment channels such
as advertisements (used by 70%) and recruitment
fairs (47%) are being supplemented by the use of
social media (43%)
â€¢	 A degree in a STEM subject gives graduates a
clear advantage in the jobs market, with nearly
half of employers (48%) reporting that they prefer
graduates with these qualifications
â€¢	 While many graduates leave university with the
skills needed for working life, businesses still
find too many do not: 17% report shortcomings
in graduate applicantsâ€™ use of English, 23% in
problem-solving and 26% in communication skills
â€¢	 Businesses want to see higher education
institutions doing more to improve the business
relevance of undergraduate courses (49%) and to
help students become job-ready (47%)
â€¢	 They would also like to see a boost to the number
(42%) and quality (27%) of STEM graduates.
Businesses and universities: partnering
for growth	
â€¢	 More than two thirds (70%) of businesses have
developed links of some type with universities and
nearly half of firms (48%) are looking to grow their
ties with universities in the future
â€¢	 The links take many forms, including activities to
enhance the business-relevance of HE by providing
â€˜real-lifeâ€™ projects and resources to help students
understand the practical relevance of their courses
(38%) and taking part in degree programme
advisory boards or contributing to course content
design (28%)
â€¢	 More than a third of firms (37%) currently partner
with universities for research and innovation,
seeking to draw on their wealth of expertise and
creativity
â€¢	 When selecting partner institutions, by far the most
important factor for businesses is a universityâ€™s
field of expertise/specialism (79%), followed by
its flexibility and responsiveness (62%) and its
location (52%).
10 Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
section 1
The seventh CBI education and skills survey, run in partnership with Pearson,
comes at a time when the economic outlook for the UK has begun to look more
positive and employment is on a rising trend. But we face a period of increased
political risk in the run up to the 2015 general election. The challenge will be in
ensuring that uncertainty does not negatively affect the positive steps towards
reform in education and skills over the past 18 months.
Key Points:
â€¢	 The recovery continues to advance, with
stronger growth and higher levels of
employment than seen in recent years â€“
however improved education and skills
are needed to secure these positive
developments.
â€¢	 Too many young people are still leaving school
without the core of literacy and numeracy they
need to be successful in life and work â€“ with
36.4% not achieving a C in GCSE English and
42.4% not reaching this standard in maths.
â€¢	 The UKâ€™s position in international education
rankings has stagnated, highlighting the need
for action.
â€¢	 Whilst youth unemployment levels have
improved over the last 12 months, they remain
high, and we must ensure the right structures
are in place to support young people in their
transitions from school.
â€¢	 Employers continue to support staff through
training and development, but it is crucial that
skills being developed reflect the needs of the
labour market.
The recovery continues to advance
Stronger economic growth seen in the first quarter of
20141
is expected to continue apace throughout the rest
of the year and into 2015.2
Positively, over the past year
the jobs market has continued to strengthen. In the
three months to March 2014 employment rose at its
fastest pace since records began, meaning 30.4 million
people were in work, up 722,000 on a year earlier.3
The unemployment rate has continued to fall hitting
a five year low of 6.8% in the three months to March
2014.4
Encouragingly young people have also benefitted
from a healthier labour market. There are now 868,000
young people out of work and looking for work, down
from one million in mid-2012.5
As economic growth
continues we expect the labour market to follow
suit. However, with the election looming, political
uncertainty remains a risk to the recovery.

But we know that to secure long-term
growth, education and skills must be the
priority
Employers know that there is no more important
issue facing the economy than getting our education
and skills system right â€“ this is the underpinning of
growth and ensuring the UK remains internationally
competitive.
Rising skill levels in other countries means that
we need action to create the flexible, highly-skilled
and motivated workforce needed to ensure British
businesses can compete in the international
marketplace.
We know that this is a challenge, and one that needs
to be tackled from the earliest stages of education
onwards.
Schools reform must be the first step
towards achieving the education and skills
system we need
Despite the continual focus on improving standards
in education, too many young people are still leaving
school without the core literacy and numeracy skills
needed to be successful in life and work. Looking at the
benchmark of at least a grade C at GCSE level in 2013
in each of these subjects we see that 36.4% of students
did not achieve this level in English and a worrying
42.4% fell short of this grade in maths.6
The education
system in the UK has for too long tolerated this long
tail of low achievement alongside a trend of rising
average performance â€“ highlighting the need for the
wide reaching reforms that we are currently seeing.
The challenge faced by education systems throughout
the UK can also be observed at the international level
by examining the OECD programme for international
student assessment (PISA) survey, which is based on
tests taken by 15-year olds. (Exhibit 2) Even taking
into account the fact that an increased number of
countries are participating in these tests, the UKâ€™s
performance can be seen to be stagnating around the
average â€“ a real worry as the standards of education
of our international competitors continue to rise.

12 Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
While English and maths abilities create the
foundation needed for all young people to be
successful, what also matters to business are the
wider attitudes and behaviours that set young people
up for working life (chapter 7). We must ensure
that the accountability framework within which
schools operate incentivises a focus on this wider
development of young people. We have seen some
positive changes to league table measures, but as
we set out in our report First Steps, an inspection
framework that looks at how well schools are
developing these wider attributes in young people is
key to securing the outcomes we need.7
The wider community, and in particular business, also
has a role to play in raising ambition and attainment in
schools â€“ and while this type of involvement is already
widespread, there is scope to deepen and improve it
(Chapter 8).
Support for transitions from school to
work is key
Young people need to be supported in their transitions
from education into employment in order to ensure
that we are making the best use of their talent â€“ and
this must start with careers guidance. We know from
research that the career aspirations of young people
are not well linked to the reality of labour market
demand.8
This needs to be tackled to ensure that we
can fill the skills gaps of the future.
Careers guidance â€“ especially in England â€“ has never
been good enough, but it remains to be seen whether
recent changes will result in positive changes. For
too long, the careers guidance young people receive
has been irrelevant, disparate and disconnected
from the jobs market â€“ and not sufficient to enable
young people to make informed decisions about their
futures (Chapter 9).

Exhibit 3 Youth unemployment in the UK (000s) 2008-14
13Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Getting this right has become increasingly important
in recent years, as the employment market that young
people are facing has become increasingly complex
â€“ and will continue to change as they go through the
education system.
Youth unemployment statistics have improved over
the last 12 months, but remain high in comparison
to pre-recession figures (Exhibit 3). We need to
build the structures that will ensure strong support
for transitions from education and training to
employment, and better signposting to the different
career options available. Effective careers guidance
that involves employers and inspires young people is
at the heart of this.
Skills mismatches highlight the need for a
demand-led skills system
Businesses know and recognise the value in providing
training for their staff and investing in the skill levels
of the workforce. UKCES estimates for example that
two thirds of employers fund or arrange training
for their staff at a cost to UK businesses of Â£42.9bn
a year.9
While the latest total investment figure is
slightly down from 2011, this is in the context of a
greater number of staff receiving training and a
shift towards more on the job or internal provision
(Chapter 5).
The question around how the government supports
investment in skills with public spending remains,
particularly in the face of concerns around
mismatches between the skills being developed and
relevant positions available in the labour market.10
This mismatch points to the need for a more
demand-led system of skills investment and training,
and we have begun to see progress towards this
over the last 12 months. Successive reviews into
apprenticeships (from Doug Richard,11
Jason Holt12
and the BIS Select Committee13
) have recognised
the vital role that apprenticeships play in delivering
the training that is needed by employers and the
necessity for the system to become more responsive
and representative of need in order to deliver value
for businesses and for the tax-payer. The challenge
will be ensuring that the reforms encourage more

businesses â€“ particularly SMEs â€“ to get involved. This
means that changes must lead to a simpler system
and reforms must be carefully piloted and phased in â€“
as set out in our recent response to the governmentâ€™s
consultation on apprenticeship funding reform.
Data from the UK Commission for Employment and
Skills (UKCES) highlights the continuing shift in the
shape of the labour market, with the majority of jobs
created between now and 2020 expected to be in
high-skilled posts. Almost half of all employment is
set to be in managerial, professional or associate
professional roles by 2020 (Exhibit 4). This shift
continues to raise concerns for employers about
their ability to meet their future workforce demands
(Chapter 3).
Prospective undergraduates are responding to
changes to student fees and heightened competition
in the UK jobs market by opting in increasing
numbers for subjects that have good employment
prospects and potential wage returns. Applications
for undergraduate courses starting in 2014/15 by
March 2014 saw the largest increases compared with
2013/14 in technologies (15%), computer science (13%)
and engineering (11%).14
In the 2014 budget the Chancellor announced funding
of Â£20 million over two years to support the growth of
higher apprenticeships up to postgraduate level.15
The
emphasis on encouraging higher apprenticeships is
reflected in levels of take-up, with the number of new
starters increasing from just 200 in 2008/09 to 9,800
in 2012/13. This increase is part of a more general
shift towards advanced and higher apprenticeships
(Exhibit 5). While higher apprenticeship starts have
increased by 165% in the last year, intermediate
apprenticeship starts have decreased by 11%.16
Higher
apprenticeships still represent a relatively small
number of total starts, however, with intermediate
still being the most common level. The total number
of apprenticeship starts has increased by more than
230,000 since 2009/10, showing the programmeâ€™s
importance as a skills pipeline.17

A further one in ten firms (10%) self-classified into the
â€˜Otherâ€™ category. Their core business activities range
from private healthcare and housing to media and the
creative industries.
The survey was conducted in the spring of 2014,
with usable responses received from 291 employers,
collectively employing more than 1.4 million people,
equivalent to 5.5% of all employees in the UK.18
Participant organisations are drawn from all sectors
of the economy and are of all sizes, from very small
firms to organisations with workforces of more than
5,000 people.
The survey was completed by a senior executive
in each organisation. In small and medium-sized
companies, this tended to be the managing director,
chief executive or chairman. In larger firms, it was
the human resources director or equivalent.
Sectoral analysis
Responses were received from across all sectors of
the economy (Exhibit 6). Private sector respondents
predominate, making up well over nine in ten
participants (96%). Manufacturing firms form the
single largest grouping of respondents, accounting
for just under a fifth (19%), while construction
and professional services businesses each make
up close to a tenth of the sample (11% and 10%
respectively). Engineering firms are also well
represented (9%).
The seventh CBI education and skills survey, run in partnership with Pearson,
captures an authoritative snapshot of trends in business opinion and practice
across a wide range of education and skills issues. Since 2008, successive
surveys have mapped how education and training have evolved against a
backdrop of economic turbulence. As the economic recovery now gathers pace,
it is more than ever essential for the UK to make the most of skills across the
current workforce and to ensure that people â€“ particularly young people â€“
develop the skills that will be needed for a prosperous future.

is from more than a third of respondents (37%) with
at least part of their workforces based in the West
Midlands to nearly a quarter (23%) with employees in

The recovery faces a mounting risk
of skill shortages
section 3
There is a serious risk that skill shortages will become a constraint as
economic recovery gathers momentum and the pace of technological change
increases. Worries about meeting the need for more and higher levels of skills
are mounting rapidly. If British businesses cannot access people with the
right skills on a sufficient scale, the UKâ€™s capacity to prosper and succeed in
international markets will be undermined. Individuals will also not be able to
progress at work and share in rising prosperity if their skills fail to keep pace
with changing demand and fit them for new job opportunities. Skills that were
adequate in the past will not suffice for the future.
Key findings:
â€¢	 Most employers consider overall skill
levels among their employees have been
satisfactory for their functions to date, with
more than two thirds (69%) rating the skills of
their high-skilled employees as good
â€¢	 But more than half of employers are aware
of weaknesses in the core competencies of
at least some of their employees in literacy
(54%), numeracy (53%) and IT skills (61%)
â€¢	 The drive towards a higher-skill economy
means that over the next three to five years,
far more businesses expect to increase the
number of jobs requiring leadership and
management skills and higher skills than
expect to reduce them (positive balances of
+73% and +71% respectively)
â€¢	 Almost as many employers expect to decrease
the number of low-skilled employees in the
next few years as to increase the number
(producing a small positive balance of +5%),
meaning there will be tough competition for
jobs among those with lower skill levels
â€¢	 Demand for more people with higher-
level skills is expected to be particularly
strong in sectors central to growth such as
engineering (+95%), manufacturing (+76%)
and construction (+69%)
â€¢	 Growing numbers of businesses are worried
there will not be sufficient skilled people to
meet this rising demand as the economic
recovery gains pace (with a balance of -23%
not confident they will be able to fill all their
higher-skills roles)
â€¢	 The confidence deficit on the availability of
enough people with the right high-level skills
applies across firms of all sizes, in all nations
of the UK and all major sectors.
19Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Skill levels have mostly been adequate
to dateâ€¦
Overall levels of skill among employees have been
largely adequate for the jobs that currently exist
and for the slow-growth conditions of recent years
(Exhibit 9). More than nine out of ten businesses
rate the skills levels of their current employees
as satisfactory or good in low-skilled roles (97%),
intermediate-skilled jobs (98%) and high-skilled
posts (98%). But the past levels of skills are no guide
to those that will be needed in the future. The bar is
constantly being raised by international competition
and technical change.
â€¦ but there are widespread weaknesses in
core competenciesâ€¦
While employers consider their workforcesâ€™ overall
levels of skills have been sufficient to cope with
their jobs to date, they are also aware of worrying
weaknesses in core competencies. A clear majority of
businesses report that they are aware of IT, literacy/
use of English and numeracy shortfalls to at least
some extent within their current workforce
(Exhibit 10).

As competitive pressures intensify and product
mixes become more sophisticated, shortcomings in
these basic skills become a greater challenge for
businesses and individuals. While in 2009 around
two in five business (40%) reported weaknesses
among some employees in literacy/use of English and
numeracy, the proportions have climbed above half in
more recent years, reaching 54% for literacy and 53%
for numeracy in 2014. When it comes to IT skills, close
to two thirds (61%) of firms report they are aware of
problems among current employees to at least some
extent, up from 57% in 2009. As the proportion of jobs
involving use of IT increases, it becomes increasingly
important to tackle gaps in IT capability.
The levels of skills needed at work will continue
to rise in the future. Achieving higher levels of
productivity and added value depend on the right
skills. So it is essential for our training and education
systems to go further and faster to add to the skills of
the current workforce and ensure that new entrants
can cope effectively. As the OECD has recognised,
low-skilled adults in the UK run the risk of getting
trapped in a situation where their skills remain weak
or deteriorate over time, making it harder for them to
learn and progress.19
The consequences of weaknesses in basic skills are
well-documented. They affect employeesâ€™ ability to
perform everyday tasks. They can hinder employeesâ€™
ability to draw out information effectively from
written texts and instructions, compose written
communications, or work through calculations and
make sense of numerical data. Shortcomings in
IT skills affect more and more jobs as the use of
technology spreads to new activities.

â€¦and those weaknesses affect all major
sectors
While shortcomings in basic skills vary from business
to business, no major sector is unaffected
(Exhibit 11).
Awareness of skills gaps is particularly widespread
among construction firms, where close to three
quarters (72%) report concerns over IT skills and
more than half over literacy/use of English (59%)
and numeracy (59%). Skills gaps are also seen as
widespread in manufacturing â€“ where the demands
made on employees by new technologies and new
processes are rising at a particularly rapid rate â€“ with
nearly two thirds of firms (62%) reporting weaknesses
in the IT skills of at least some employees. Two
thirds of firms (68%) across retail and hospitality,
transport and distribution, and other services
recognise shortfalls in numeracy among at least
some employees, with 13% reporting weaknesses to a
significant extent across their workforces.

Rising levels of skill will be needed in
the future
In the years ahead, British businesses will need
more people able to fill skilled jobs. The results of
our survey show the strength of the drive towards
a higher-skill economy and the changing future
shape of skill needs (Exhibit 12). Sustained economic
recovery will intensify the push towards greater
levels of skill.
Over the next three to five years, far more employers
expect to need more people with leadership and
management skills than expect to need fewer (76%
expect to need more, 4% to need fewer and 21% no
change, producing a positive balance of +72%). The
balance of businesses expecting to require more
people with leadership and management skills has
been above +60% every year since 2010, and it has
gained added impetus as the economic recovery
becomes more securely based. The positive balance

Only among roles in the low skills category are
job prospects less strongly positive. Half (49%) of
employers expect no change in their number of
low-skill jobs in the years ahead, and almost as
many expect to reduce the number of low-skilled
posts as to increase them, producing a small positive
balance of +5%. This trend â€“ likely driven by the UKâ€™s
stronger economic performance over the past year,
brings to an end the negative balances shown by
our surveys since 2010, but the results highlight the
tough competition for job openings among those with
the lowest levels of skills. Among those businesses
employing 250 people and above, the numbers
planning to reduce low-skill jobs match those
expecting to create new openings.
Demand for skills will be strongest in high-
growth sectors
Employer demand for more people with higher level
skills in the next three to five years is expected to be
particularly strong in those sectors that should lead the
rebalancing of the economy (Exhibit 13). Engineering
(a positive balance of +95%) and manufacturing (+76%)
head the list of sectors anticipating greater demand for
recruits with higher skills, with firms in construction
expecting to increase their demand both for those with
higher skills (+69%) and intermediate skills (+59%).
Achieving sustained growth depends on the capacity
to meet these skill needs, particularly by encouraging
more young people to recognise the opportunities open
to them in these sectors.
Exhibit 12 Employer demand for different
skills levels over the next 3-5 years (%)*
of firms expecting to need more employees with other
higher skills has been only a little lower over the
same period (climbing to +71% in 2014). Larger firms
expect to lead the growth in demand for those with
higher-level skills (with a positive balance of +78%
among non-SMEs compared with +58% among SMEs).
As economic growth continues to pick up, survey
respondents also expect to need more people with
intermediate skills in the next three to five years. The
balance of employers anticipating adding jobs over
those cutting intermediate roles has risen from +30%
in 2013 to +40% in 2014.

22 Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Can the growing demand for more skilled
employees be met?
Employers are losing confidence that they will be able
to attract and retain the right skill mix of employees
in the years ahead. As the economic recovery gains
pace, businesses expect it will become much harder
to fill their more skilled vacancies.
When it comes to filling high-skilled jobs in future
(Exhibit 14), last year the proportion of businesses
(46%) not confident they would be able to find
sufficient recruits matched those (46%) who believed
there would be enough people available to them
(producing a 0% confidence balance). This year a big
gap has opened up: more than half of employers are
not confident they will be able to recruit enough high-
skill employees (58%), while only a third are confident
(35%), giving a negative confidence balance of -23%.
Worries over filling high-skilled posts apply
across the UKâ€¦
Levels of confidence about being able to access
sufficient high-skill employees in future have fallen
sharply across all parts of the UK (Exhibit 15). The
biggest turn around in confidence has been in
Northern Ireland, with a drop from a large positive
confidence balance in 2013 (of +29%) to a heavily
negative -27% in 2014. Confidence about recruitment
of those with high skills among businesses in
Scotland too has swung from a positive balance (+1%
in 2013) to a negative one (-24%) this year.

â€¦affecting firms of all sizes and key
sectors
Concerns about filling future high-skilled openings
affect firms of all sizes. Among SMEs, firms believing
that in the coming years they may not be able to
recruit sufficient employees with the high skills they
will need outnumber those that are confident about
future recruitment (by a balance of -12%). Worries are
even more widespread among larger firms (with a
negative confidence balance of -30%).
Within individual sectors (Exhibit 16), there have been
big falls in confidence about being able to recruit
sufficient highly skilled staff in future. Professional
services firms, for example, have swung from a positive
confidence balance of +33% in 2013 to 0% in 2014.
Construction businesses have moved from a relatively
small negative balance of -4% to -48% in 2014.
These findings highlight the urgent need for more
action to boost skills if the pace of economic recovery
is not to be held back. Ensuring continued success
in the sectors where the UK has a competitive
advantage will be at the heart of a successful
industrial strategy for the UK. It is a real concern that
sectors that are central to the UKâ€™s future growth
anticipate problems accessing the skilled staff they
will need.

Science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) skills underpin innovation
and the UKâ€™s ability to compete successfully in high-value, high-growth sectors.
Demand for these skills is rising strongly as economic recovery takes hold.
This is already causing a rise in the proportion of businesses reporting current
difficulties in recruiting technicians and experienced staff with STEM skills.
And the shortage problems are expected to intensify in the coming years. There
is an urgent need to improve the supply of STEM-skilled people if economic
growth is not to be held back.
Key findings:
â€¢	 Nearly two in five firms (39%) that need
employees with STEM skills and knowledge
currently have difficulties recruiting staff
at some level and over half (53%) expect
problems in the next three years
â€¢	 Shortages of STEM-qualified technicians are
particularly widespread, with more than a
quarter (28%) of firms in STEM-based sectors
reporting current difficulties in recruitment
and more than a third (35%) anticipating
problems over the next three years
â€¢	 Shortages of STEM graduates are also starting
to be experienced (by 19%) and are expected
to affect many more STEM-based firms (28%)
in the coming years
â€¢	 Difficulties in recruiting people with STEM
skills are expected to be most severe in the
construction sector as major new projects get
under way, with firms anticipating problems
in the next three years in finding technicians
(48%), graduate recruits (37%) and suitable
people to train as apprentices (36%)
â€¢	 Businesses have concerns about both the
quality (48%) and quantity (46%) of STEM
graduates, and report that too many lack
general workplace experience (39%)
â€¢	 To fire interest among young people in
studying STEM subjects and pursuing STEM
careers, businesses recognise that they have
a key role in engaging with schools (57%) and
offering more STEM-based apprenticeships
(57%). They also see the need to work with
universities to ensure the business-relevance
of courses (54%)
â€¢	 There is a critically important role for
government in ensuring there is an adequate
supply of specialist science and maths
teachers in schools to equip young people
with knowledge and enthusiasm for STEM
(cited by 50% of respondents).
STEM skills in short supply
section 4
25Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
People with STEM skills are becoming
harder to recruitâ€¦
Science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM)
skills are vital to the UKâ€™s ability to sustain and
develop high value-added industries â€“ they underpin
the UKâ€™s future economic growth. Those with STEM
skills are in demand at all levels from apprentice and
technician level upwards.20
Among those businesses that recruit employees with
STEM skills and knowledge, well over a third (39%)
report current difficulties recruiting STEM-skilled
staff at some level (Exhibit 17). So despite STEM
shortages being high on the agenda for both business
and government, the supply of STEM skills is still
inadequate and has worsened markedly at key levels
as the recovery has gained traction.
More than one in four employers report difficulties
in meeting their need for technicians (28%) and
experienced staff with STEM expertise (26%). In both
cases these figures are higher than in 2013 (in our last
survey they were 14% and 22% respectively). Finding
suitable graduate recruits has also become more of a
problem, with nearly one in five (19%) reporting current
difficulties in 2014 compared with 12% in 2013. There
has been a jump too in the proportion of employers
reporting difficulties in recruiting people with STEM
skills to train as apprentices (from 12% to 22%).
Given the central role of STEM skills in the UKâ€™s growth
strategy, there is plainly an urgent need for action,
as the recent CBI report on the contribution of STEM
skills to our economic future shows (Exhibit 18).

â€¦and businesses expect the difficulties to
intensify
Businesses needing STEM-skilled staff believe the
recruitment market will become much more difficult
in the years ahead as the economic recovery gathers
momentum. The proportion anticipating difficulties over
the next three years has climbed from two in five (41%)
in 2013 to more than half (53%) in 2014 (Exhibit 19).
More than a third of firms recruiting STEM staff
expect difficulties in finding suitable technicians
(35%) and experienced STEM staff (36%) in the next
three years. For both groups the proportions of
businesses in 2014 anticipating problems are much
higher than last year (20% and 17% respectively in
2013). The supply of STEM graduates too is expected
to be inadequate, with the proportion of employers
anticipating problems in the next three years rising
to 28% from 10% last year. At postgraduate level, the
percentage of firms expecting recruitment problems
has doubled (from 12% in 2013 to 25% in 2014). These
are troubling findings.
With science, technology, engineering and maths
(STEM) skills critical to the UKâ€™s success, the CBI report,
Engineering our Future: stepping up the urgency on STEM
sets out the need for a new impetus in expanding our
STEM skills base. As the economy rebalances towards
manufacturing, investment and exports, major growth
sectors must be confident that the supply of skilled people
will grow with their businesses in the years ahead. The
report warns that skills shortages are threatening our
recovery as demand for workers with STEM skills â€“
particularly skilled technicians â€“ outstrips supply.
To increase the pipeline of STEM skilled workers we must
ensure that the value of STEM-related qualifications and
jobs are better showcased and more routes into such
careers are created, especially for women who are poorly
represented in many STEM fields. We need to tackle
both long and short-term demand by retraining existing
workers, creating more apprenticeships and ensuring

Shortage of STEM skills is impacting some
of our key growth sectors hardest
The mounting difficulties in recruiting STEM-skilled
people currently and in the future (Exhibit 20) are
intense in sectors that should be driving future
economic growth. The Governmentâ€™s industrial
strategy sectors â€“ aerospace, agri-tech, automotive,
construction, education, information economy, life
sciences, nuclear, oil and gas, offshore wind, and
professional and business services â€“ are amongst
those most in need of increases in amount and quality
of skills.22
In manufacturing, nearly one in four firms (24%)
reports current difficulties in recruiting technicians,
while more than a third (36%) expect problems in the
coming three years. In the construction sector too, one
in four (24%) reports current problems in recruiting
technicians, and nearly half (48%) of construction
firms anticipate problems over the next three years as
the sector expands rapidly. In engineering, well over
a quarter (29%) of businesses report difficulties in
finding suitable technicians and the same proportion
expect those problems to continue.
More difficulties are also expected in recruiting
suitable people to train as apprentices in the coming
years as the economy strengthens, with over a third
of firms in all these sectors foreseeing problems.
These findings highlight the need for balanced,
effective careers advice to help young people
understand the range of opportunities open to them
in these and related sectors. Major challenges are
also foreseen over STEM graduate recruitment.
In construction, for example, more than one in
three firms (37%) expects difficulties in filling their
vacancies in the next three years.
The calibre of STEM graduates also needs
attention
When asked about the barriers they encounter
in filling jobs that require STEM-linked skills and
qualifications, employers point to a range of concerns
(Exhibit 21).
Heading the list is the troubling finding that nearly
half of those respondents (48%) experiencing
problems have concerns about the quality of STEM
graduates. This ranks just ahead of the problem of a
shortage of STEM graduates (at 46%). Compounding
this problem â€“ and probably a major factor behind
the worries over graduate calibre â€“ is that the content
of qualifications at all levels is too often not relevant
to business needs (33%). These findings highlight
the need for firms and education and training

of study properly reflect workplace developments
and technological advances in manufacturing and
science-based industries.
A lack of general workplace experience among
applicants (39%) and weaknesses in the attitudes and
aptitudes for working life among candidates (30%) are
also identified as common problems. These findings
highlight the need for young people to develop their
understanding and gain some experience of the day-
to-day demands of the workplace, preferably in the
sector where they aim to work longer term.

STEM progress needs action by businesses
and educationâ€¦
There is a clear need for action to promote the study
of STEM subjects and so increase the future supply
of STEM-skilled employees. When asked how best
to achieve this, respondents see essential roles for
businesses, educational bodies and government
(Exhibit 22).
Three priorities for action are identified by more than
half of respondent businesses. First, businesses
need to engage with schools to enthuse pupils about
STEM study (57%). They can inject an invaluable â€˜real
worldâ€™ perspective, opening young peopleâ€™s eyes to
the practical value and exciting creative scope of
STEM subjects. Equally important is the creation of
more STEM-related apprenticeships (57%). These
are particularly important to tackle the current and
impending shortages of technicians. Progress on this
will in part rely on addressing the quality of vocational
education through the newly introduced qualifications
(see Chapter 7).
A majority of respondents (54%) also point to the
need to tackle the low business relevance of some
STEM qualifications. This requires employers and
universities to work together more closely to develop
STEM courses with built-in business relevance,
with employers for example participating in degree
programme advisory boards or the creation of
entirely new degree courses. This can help tackle the
worries over the quality of STEM graduates.
Firing young peopleâ€™s interest in STEM careers
through schemes such as the STEM ambassadorsâ€™
programme23
is widely recognised as important.
This is reflected in the view of more than a third
of respondents (38%) that employees should be
encouraged to become STEM ambassadors as part of
meeting the current challenge. And there is the added
challenge of encouraging more young women to
â€¦but also by government
Government too has an essential role in fostering
development of STEM-skilled young people. First,
there can be no let-up in the push to recruit and retain
more specialist STEM teachers in schools, with half
of businesses (50%) pointing to the need for action.
The government has recognised the importance of
focusing funding on meeting the need for specialist
teachers in England.24
But after a period in which
figures on initial teacher training suggested real
progress was being made, the latest trends are
worrying.25
In 2013/14, the number of new entrants
to maths teaching programmes was only 90% of the
target, while for physics the numbers fell back to
72% of the target. Moreover, only two thirds of those
trainee teachers held a first or 2.1 class degree (67%
for maths and 65% for physics) compared with three
quarters (74%) of trainee teachers as a whole.
Far from tackling the hangover of too few specialist
STEM teachers in schools and colleges, there is a
real risk that the problem may intensify: over a fifth
of those in secondary schools in England teaching
maths (22%) and chemistry (24%) and a third of
physics teachers (34%) have no qualification in the
subject beyond A level.26
There is a pressing need
for high-quality teaching by specialists to foster
enthusiasm and interest among young people in
maths and science. The announcement of the Maths
and Physics Chairs programme from September 2014
to increase the supply of maths and physics teachers
with high-level subject expertise in non-selective
state schools is therefore a welcome development.27
see STEM careers as open to them and an attractive
option. Initiatives such as the Women into technology
and engineering compact have an important part to
play in this (Exhibit 23).
There is a clear need for action to promote the
study of STEM subjects and so increase the
future supply of STEM-skilled employees.

Exhibit 23 Women into technology and
engineering compact
The Women into technology and engineering
compact asks organisations to work together in
a national partnership-led campaign of activity
to boost female participation in technology and
engineering. Supported by the CBI and other
organisations, the aim of the compact is to
support a step-change in how women and girls
are encouraged to consider technology and
engineering careers and the subject choices
or vocational pathways â€“ especially the study
of maths and physics â€“ that lead to them. The
compact asks businesses to commit to concrete
action in the following areas:
â€¢	 Engaging with young people
â€¢  	Contributing to a national campaign
â€¢ 	 	Increasing women in technology and
engineering in their own	organisation.
Action is particularly important if uptake of triple
science GCSE â€“ the best preparation for A-level and
beyond â€“ is to improve. Since 2009/10, the percentage
of pupils in state-funded schools entered for triple
science has risen from 19% to 28% in 2012/13,28
but
continuing that positive trend depends on having the
right teachers in place.
In higher education, the government is already taking
steps to weight funding support towards STEM as
high-cost subjects. This type of support is essential,
with two in five businesses (40%) highlighting the
importance of the government tilting higher education
in favour of STEM subjects.29
There is also a case
for better streamlining of the varied initiatives to
promote STEM study (seen as a priority by 31% of
respondents). While a variety of programmes and
campaigns can mean different audiences are reached,
there is a risk of confusion and duplication of effort.
There could be a role for government in encouraging
some streamlining and better co-ordination.

section 5
Businesses recognise their responsibility to develop the skills of their
workforces to meet their future needs. They are planning for a step change in
the scale of their investment in skills in response to the economic recovery. But
they need schools, colleges and universities to be preparing young people to
enter the world of work equipped with the right competencies and attitudes and
for external training bodies to provide high-quality, flexible and cost-effective
training. They also need scope to steer the skills agenda effectively.
Businesses are stepping
up skills investment
33Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Firms are planning a major boost in skills
investment
Businesses recognise that it is more important than
ever to maintain or increase their levels of investment
in training to take advantage of the opportunities
opened up by economic recovery. They are also keenly
aware of the risks of potential skills shortages.
We asked respondents what impact the economic
climate is having on their plans to invest in training
and development of their staff over the next 12
months (Exhibit 24). The results show a third of firms
(34%) plan to increase their level of spend, while just
one in twelve (8%) plans to cut back, giving a positive
balance of +26% intending to increase their training
and development investment. This is far ahead of last
yearâ€™s positive balance of +6% and a zero balance in
2012. Overall, more than nine in ten businesses (92%)
intend to maintain or increase their current spending
on training in the coming year.
The determination to maintain or increase investment
in training and development applies to employers
right across the UK (Exhibit 25). In the devolved
nations balances of those planning to increase
investment over those planning reductions range
from +30% in Wales to +34% in Scotland. Analysed
by company size, a positive balance of +19% of SMEs
intend to increase their training spend, rising to +28%
among larger firms.

Construction leads the growth in training
investmentâ€¦
The results show major variations between sectors
over training and development intentions in the
coming year (Exhibit 26). The positive balance of
firms planning increased investment over those
planning reductions is particularly strong in
construction at +44%, reflecting recognition of the
need to tackle the risk of skill shortages holding
businesses back. Other sectors where plans to grow
training investment are well above those of firms as
a whole include professional services (+42%) and
manufacturing (+34%).
At a time when the UK needs to be renewing large
parts of its infrastructure and expanding its high-
value activities, it is encouraging that firms are
responding in this way with targeted expansion of
training and development investment.
â€¦and firms want that investment to yield
good returns
Measuring levels of investment in training and
development in cash terms is one side of the
equation. The other is the effectiveness of that
training in equipping employees with relevant skills to
add value.
Over half of businesses (59%) report that in the
coming year they intend to target training more
effectively on those employees where it will make
the biggest difference (Exhibit 27). A majority (55%)
of respondents also intend to seek more cost-
effective routes for delivering training. A particularly
cost-effective approach â€“ and one exactly geared
to an organisationâ€™s needs â€“ is to conduct training
on-the-job or deliver it internally. Just over half of
businesses (51%) plan to increase the amount of
training delivered in this way. Among the one in ten
respondents (9%) planning other changes are moves
to work collaboratively with other businesses to share
delivery.

Too much training investment is still being
diverted into remedial education
All too often, employers are having to divert funding
and resources into remedial education to make up
for shortcomings in basic competencies (Exhibit 28).
Close to half of employers (44%) say that in the past
year they have organised training in at least one basic
skill area for adult employees. IT skills have been
the most common area in need of attention, with
39% of businesses reporting that they have provided
remedial training for at least some adult employees.
There has been less widespread activity on literacy/
use of English (15%) and numeracy (13%), but even
these figures are disturbingly high, showing little
improvement over the years.
More than a quarter of businesses (28%) report they
have organised remedial training for at least some
young people joining them from school or college.
Most commonly this has been in literacy/use of
English (22%), but even among young people one in 12

firms (13%) has had to provide help for at least some
in acquiring basic IT skills. For graduate recruits,
nearly one in six employers (15%) reports providing
remedial training in at least one area during the past
12 months. The most common area for assistance has
been IT skills (by 8% of businesses).
The lack of improvement in these figures over the
years shows there is deep-rooted underperformance
in parts of our schools systems. The CBIâ€™s First Steps
report30
set out the case for a major rethink, based
on identifying the outcomes we want our schools to
achieve and the capabilities we want every school
leaver to possess. The nations of the UK cannot
continue to tolerate educational shortfalls on this
scale â€“ particularly as our competitors across the
globe drive up their standards. We must ensure that
all young people are better supported in developing
the skills, attitudes and behaviours that they need for
success in work and life.
36 Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Training delivery depends on effective
partnership
Businesses rely on a range of partners to help equip
employees with the skills they need in their current
jobs and to develop them for the future. While just
over half of training (51%) is delivered in-house â€“
through a combination of on-the-job and off-the-job
development â€“ on average 49% of training is carried
out by external providers (Exhibit 29). With business
confidence recovering fast and skill needs increasing,
the proportion of training conducted by external
bodies is well up on last yearâ€™s average level (41%).
The increase in the use of external partners to train
and develop employees applies across organisations
of all sizes. The average proportion of training
delivered by external specialists now ranges from
55% among the smallest businesses employing under
50 people to 40% among those with 5,000 employees.
Our survey shows some marked variations between
sectors. While among professional services firms only
just over a third (37%) of training and development
is delivered by external partners on average, the
proportion climbs to almost two thirds (64%) among
construction businesses. Manufacturing is exactly in
line with the all-sector average, with 49% of training
on average delivered by external providers.
Thereâ€™s scope for training providers to up
their gameâ€¦
On almost every measure, employers over recent
years have become more satisfied with the training
delivered by external providers.31
But there is still
scope for providers to improve their provision in
important respects.
Private providers remain by far the most common
choice for employers using external training and
development provision (Exhibit 30). More than four
in five (88%) of those firms in our survey drawing
on outside providers look to private trainers. They
are often called on to deliver short, unaccredited
courses to address particular needs or changes.
Further education colleges are also used by a clear
majority (59%), particularly to support delivery
of apprenticeship programmes and similar skills
training. Although less commonly used, many
universities have expanded their services to
businesses in recent years. Among those firms using
outside providers, close to half (45%) now draw on
universities for at least some programmes.
Private providers achieve the highest employer
satisfaction ratings on every measure (Exhibit 31). On
overall responsiveness to an organisationâ€™s training
requirements, for example, the balance of those
businesses satisfied with private providers over those
dissatisfied stands at +93%, far ahead of the positive
balances for universities and FE colleges (+63% and
+56% respectively). Nonetheless, across all categories
of training provider, a high proportion of firms give a
positive assessment on essential measures such as
quality of trainers and the relevance of course content
to skill and business needs.

â€¦with flexibility to meet business
operations in need of improvement
The costs of training will always be a concern for a
business, with the positive balance of satisfaction
dipping to as low as +23% in the case of the cost
of university programmes. The other areas where
there is still scope for progress concern conducting
training in ways that fit with the day-to-day running
of the business. Delivering training on employer
premises or at another convenient location can often
be important. But a positive balance of less than
three quarters (+72%) of those businesses using FE
colleges and +58% of those using universities report
that training has been delivered in locations that suit
their business needs.
The timing of training delivery matters too. While
there are plenty of instances of training delivered, for
example, to meet the needs of those working shifts
and weekends, or at more quiet business periods, not
all training providers adapt suitably. While a positive
balance of nine in ten employers (+91%) using an
external private provider say training is delivered
at times to suit their organisationâ€™s needs, that
balance falls to +68% for FE colleges and +64% for
universities.

Employers want greater control of
qualification design
Achieving best use of resources by ensuring the
business-relevance of training depends on employers
taking ownership of the agenda. Over the past 18
months the government has taken steps to lay the
foundations for a more demand-led system, ceding
greater control of resource allocation to business.
It is now widely recognised that too often in the
past public resources committed to training and
development have been poorly targeted.
This direction of policy is welcome, but there is
much more to be done. Asked to identify their
three top priorities for moving this agenda forward,
respondents highlight the need to base qualification
design on employersâ€™ needs and industry standards
(Exhibit 32). This is cited as among their leading
priorities by more than four in five business (84%) and
as the single most important one by over half (54%).
It is clearly at the very heart of employer ownership.
Respondents also see a broader need to raise
awareness of the skills initiatives already under way
and how businesses can engage effectively with
these in practice (72%). Only if there is widespread
involvement by businesses will employer ownership
become a meaningful reality. Nearly two thirds
(65%) of firms also see shaping of design standards
for vocational qualifications by employer-led
partnerships as an important issue to ensure those
qualifications meet real business needs. This is seen
as even more important than giving employers direct
control of skills funding (cited as a priority by 38%).
Real progress is now being made. The plans, for
example, for a new college to deliver the specialised
training and qualifications required for high-speed
rail to meet the needs of HS2 and other future
infrastructure projects illustrate the potential..32
But
all parties need to be moving further and faster.

Shaping a fully effective
apprenticeship system
section 6
Key findings:
â€¢	 The proportion of employers involved in
apprenticeships has risen to more than two
thirds of our survey in the past two years (69%
in 2013 and 68% in 2014) from only half (51%)
in 2009
â€¢	 Two thirds of those offering apprenticeships
(69%) plan to extend their programmes
in future while across all respondents
one in eight (13%) plans to start offering
apprenticeships in the next three years
â€¢	 Provision of apprenticeships is spreading
into new sectors such professional services
(where 42% of businesses now have at least
some apprentices)
â€¢	 Leading priorities for action to encourage
expansion in apprenticeship programmes
include more relevant qualification
programmes (44%), giving firms greater
purchasing power by routing the
apprenticeship grant directly to employers
(34%) and reducing bureaucracy (31%)
â€¢	 Greater simplification and streamlining of
the system and action by schools to prepare
young people would encourage increased
provision by SMEs â€“ currently half of SMEs
have no apprentices compared to less
than one on ten (8%) firms with over 5,000
employees.
Apprenticeships are vital to raising skill levels in our economy, enabling people
to earn while they learn and opening the way to fulfilling, well-paid careers.
The number of apprenticeship opportunities has grown rapidly in recent
years as employers have recognised their value as a means of developing the
skilled people they increasingly need. The government has rightly increased its
support for apprenticeships, but there is still more to be done to develop a truly
demand-led apprenticeship system under business leadership.
41Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
The apprenticeship system has seen rapid
growthâ€¦
More than half a million people (510,200) started
apprenticeship programmes in 2012/13. This is an
encouraging figure, standing more than 230,000
higher than in 2009/10 and showing the strength of
the drive to improve the UK skills pipeline.33
Across our 2014 respondents as a whole, more
than two thirds of employers (68%) are currently
involved in providing at least some apprenticeship
places (Exhibit 33). This means the growth in
apprenticeships over recent years has been
consolidated, following the climb in the proportion
of businesses involved in apprenticeships from just
under half of respondents (48%) in 2008 to above
two thirds (69%) last year. The challenge now is
to raise the proportion of businesses involved in
apprenticeships still further.
â€¦and there is scope for further expansion
Prospects for further expansion of the programme
are strong. Well over half (60%) of employers either
intend to expand their current apprenticeship
programmes or plan to start providing apprenticeship
places in the next three years (Exhibit 34). The
proportion of businesses that report they are already
involved in providing some apprenticeship places and
plan to expand their schemes in future has risen from
41% in 2012 to just under half (47%) this year. This is
equivalent to more than two thirds (69%) of all those
currently engaged in apprenticeship provision.

Involvement in apprenticeships has spread far
beyond the sectors with which they are traditionally
associated (Exhibit 35). While more than four in
five respondents (84%) in manufacturing have
apprentices, nearly two thirds of firms (65%) in
retail and hospitality, transport and distribution,
and other services, and two in five professional
services businesses (42%) are also now engaged
in apprentice training provision to at least some
degree. The expansion of apprenticeships into more
sectors shows the growing variety of businesses that
recognise the value of this type of training and the
new fields in which it can be applied.
For continued expansion business must
have the leading role 	
The past couple of years have been a period
of reflection on the UK apprenticeship system.
Reviews by Doug Richard,34
Jason Holt35
and the
BIS Select Committee36
recognised the vital role
of apprenticeships in delivering business-focused
training, equipping people with the skills and
knowledge to carry out demanding roles, boost
productivity and add value within their organisations.
But while apprenticeships support people into
fulfilling, well-paid jobs, enabling them to â€˜learn while

you earnâ€™ and opening the way to varied careers,
the reviews also identified that the system needs
to become more effectively demand-led to produce
better value for businesses and the taxpayer.
Our survey asked employers about the three top
measures that would encourage them to become more
involved in apprenticeship programmes (Exhibit 36).
The most important issue, cited by more than two
fifths of respondents, is qualification programmes that
are more relevant to business needs (44%).
Putting more purchasing power in the hands of
firms by routing the apprenticeship grant directly to
employers also ranks highly (34%). This is particularly
an issue for larger businesses: some 38% of those
employing 250 people and above identify this as
a priority for action, compared with 27% of SMEs.
Nearly a third of all respondents also want to see
reductions in bureaucracy (31%) â€“ a clearer and
simpler system would be an important step in
enabling businesses to exercise greater leadership
over the apprenticeship system. These priorities are
reflected in our response37
to the recent government
consultation on apprenticeship funding which
highlighted the need for an apprenticeship system
that works for firms of all sizes, that responds to
businessesâ€™ demands for simplicity and which routes
funding directly to employers.
Other important areas in need of attention include
greater flexibility for employers to be able to
design bespoke apprenticeship frameworks (28%).
This would be a valuable step towards ensuring
apprenticeship training and qualifications fit more
closely with business needs. Schools and colleges
also have an important role to play in partnership
with employers to ensure that more of the young
people who apply for apprentice places are suitably
qualified and motivated. Across businesses as a
whole this is seen a priority by one in four (26%),
rising to nearer one in three (30%) among SMEs.

Thereâ€™s scope to involve many more SMEs
While more than a quarter of the smallest firms (29%)
have some involvement with apprenticeships, that
still leaves the great majority of these businesses
â€“ which include the major employers of the future â€“
with no engagement at all with the apprenticeship
system (Exhibit 37). It is also clear that medium-sized
enterprises remain relatively under-represented
among providers of apprenticeships. While four in five
businesses (80%) employing over 500 people offer
apprenticeship places (rising to over 90% among
those 5,000 or more staff) only just over half (55%) of
firms in the 200 to 500 employees band are currently
involved.
The imbalance in the scale of involvement by smaller
businesses highlights the importance of reducing the
bureaucracy around apprenticeships and ensuring
that programmes fit more closely with business
needs. It also illustrates the need for effective
support structures, such as through Apprenticeship
Training Agencies or Group Training Associations,
to simplify the process for smaller businesses and
reduce the risks involved in participation. It is these
factors rather than cost that smaller firms too often
find off-putting. Jason Holtâ€™s review set out a clear
pathway to boosting apprenticeship uptake among
SMEs by tackling these issues, but we have yet to
see reforms having a major practical impact. There is
scope for FE colleges â€“ often the key training partners
for apprenticeships â€“ to up their game to ensure the
relevance and quality of programmes.

What happens at school is crucially important for individuals in their lives,
for the businesses that employ them and for the wider economy. If the right
standards are not set and achieved during education, people and their
employers risk being disadvantaged. Moreover, standards of schooling that
might once have been adequate are no longer good enough. Competitor nations
across the world are continually driving up their educational standards. It is
essential that the UK responds effectively and does not slip behind.
Key findings:
â€¢	 	Businesses are becoming concerned about
the increasing educational divergence
between different UK nations: two thirds (67%)
believe it is important that qualifications are
directly comparable and readily understood
by employers
â€¢	 Levels of awareness about the new vocational
qualifications are very low among businesses,
with 85% knowing little or nothing about them
â€¢	 The most important factors employers weigh
up when recruiting school and college leavers
are their attitudes to work (85%), their general
aptitudes (63%) and literacy and numeracy
(44%). These rank well ahead of formal
academic results (38%)
â€¢	 	Many businesses are not satisfied with the
attitudes and skills of school leavers in
important areas including attitudes to work
(33%), teamwork (36%), basic numeracy (38%),
problem solving (50%) and communication
skills (52%)
â€¢	 Businesses want to see primary schools
concentrating above all on developing pupilsâ€™
literacy and numeracy (85%), with these also
as the most commonly cited priority (by 62%)
in the 11-14 phase of schooling
â€¢	 For the 14-19 age group, employers believe the
top priority for schools and colleges should
be developing awareness of working life with
support from businesses (52%)
â€¢	 	Almost two thirds of businesses (65%)
value foreign language skills among their
employees, particularly in helping build
relations with clients, customers and
suppliers (28%)
â€¢	 French (50%) and German (49%) are the
leading languages in demand by firms, but
those geared towards business in China
are increasingly seen as useful (with those
valuing knowledge of Mandarin up from 25%
in 2012 to 31% in 2014).

Raising the performance
of our schools
45Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Businesses want young people who are
rigorous, rounded and groundedâ€¦
There is no more important contributor to long-term
economic success than education, so the quality of our
school and college systems is of central importance
to employers. Businesses want young people who are
rigorous, rounded and grounded â€“ with not only key
skills and knowledge, but also, crucially, the attitudes
and behaviours needed for success in life and work.
Stretching academic standards are necessary but
not sufficient to success in this, as emphasised in the
CBIâ€™s First Steps report38
(Exhibit 38).
With our international competitors pushing up levels
of achievement every year, raising ambition for all in
schools is of fundamental importance to business.39
Employers look to schools to develop confident,
motivated young people with the attitudes, core
knowledge and behaviours that will prepare them for
success in life outside the school gates.
Exhibit 38 First Steps: A new approach for
our schools
In November 2012, CBI published First Steps, a
comprehensive look at businessesâ€™ priorities for
the education system. Working with teachers,
headteachers and business, we set out a
pathway for reform that includes:
â€¢	 Developing a clear statement of the outcomes
all schools should deliver
â€¢	 Ensuring the accountability system -
particularly the Ofsted framework - is
reformed to reflect this statement
â€¢	 Empowering school leaders and teachers
â€¢	 Closing the attainment gap at primary level
â€¢	 Aligning the curriculum and examination at
secondary level with the desired outcomes
â€¢	 Encouraging business engagement
While some progress has been made in key
areas, more still needs to be done to clearly
specify outcomes and to ensure schools are
held accountable for how these outcomes are
delivered. In particular, we need reform of the
Ofsted framework to ensure that both academic
progress and the development of character are
prioritised by schools.

â€¦with comparable standards across all
nations of the UK
The increasing divergence of school and qualification
performance in the different parts of the UK is
becoming a concern for businesses (Exhibit 39).
School and exam systems are one of the main
responsibilities devolved to the administrations of
the different nations of the UK, and recent reforms to
qualifications have moved these systems even further
away from each other. While devolution of control
over schools is something businesses support, clarity
over standards and exam rigour is an essential part
of ensuring all young people get the education the
need, and that employers are clear about the level
students have reached. There is a risk of drift towards
increasingly disparate arrangements and uneven
levels of performance and assessment, so it is
essential devolved authorities are able to learn from
each other about what works.
The latest results from the OECD Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA), for example,
illustrate the extent of differences within the UK in
2012 and the scale of challenge against international
competitors in essential skill areas such as maths
and science.40
Across the economy as a whole, two thirds of
employers (67%) believe it is important that
qualifications from all parts of the UK are comparable
and readily understood by employers. A particular
concern here is where exams with the same name
â€“ for instance the English GCSE and the Welsh GCSE â€“
are held to differing standards. Businesses need to be
confident that they can recruit people with genuinely
comparable levels of qualification and that they are
clear about the level of skills and knowledge that
can be expected among those recruits. Otherwise
there is a real risk of the UK qualifications landscape
becoming increasingly confusing, to the detriment of
young people and their potential employers. We know
from the example of the Scottish qualification system
that a differentiated system can work well, but what is
key here is clarity and employer confidence.
The concerns about comparability and clarity in
educational standards are held by a large majority
of employers throughout the UK (Exhibit 40).
Proportions of respondents viewing increased
divergence as a cause for concern range from nearly
two thirds in Wales (63%) to seven in ten (70%) in
Northern Ireland.
Looking at levels of concern by organisation size,
SMEs and larger businesses are virtually equally
concerned (69% and 68% respectively).

Most employers know little about the new
vocational qualifications
A key driver of success of qualifications is confidence
that they are equipping young people with skills
and qualifications that are valued by employers. It
is therefore important that changes in qualifications
and the skills and knowledge they reflect are
communicated effectively to businesses. The results
from our survey show the government has a major
job to do in explaining to business the new vocational
qualifications for young people that will start to be
delivered in England from September.41
The new Tech Levels and Applied General
qualifications are an attempted answer to businessesâ€™
call for a gold standard vocational qualification to sit
alongside the academic A Level at age 18. They are
geared to the needs of students wishing to specialise
in a technical career (for example in engineering,
IT or accounting) or a range of other recognised
occupations, and are recognised by relevant trade or
professional bodies. Businesses remain concerned by
the complexity of a two-qualification model.
Introduction of the new qualifications is an important
development, although it is early days and it remains
to be seen whether they deliver on their promise.
But it is essential for employers to be aware of
them and for more to engage with the process of
approval to ensure their success and recognition in
the employment market. Only one in eight businesses
(12%) reports a high level of awareness, including
just 3% engaged with the process. A troubling
half of businesses (50%) are not aware of the new
qualifications, while a further third (35%) have only a
little awareness (Exhibit 41).

Attitudes to work among young people
matter most
When it comes to recruiting school and college
leavers, (Exhibit 42) our survey results show the
overwhelming importance of young peopleâ€™s attitudes
to work. More than four out of five employers (85%)
rate this as one of their three most important
considerations. This comes as no surprise and is
in line with our previous research.42
The CBI has
long pointed to the central importance of a positive
attitude, demonstrated for example by a readiness to
take part, openness to new ideas and activities, and a
desire to achieve. It also involves understanding that
hard work and effort yields results.
Also ranking ahead of formal academic results and
qualifications are young peopleâ€™s aptitudes for work
(cited as important by 63%) and core skills such as
basic literacy and numeracy (44%). In day-to-day
working life, personal attitudes, aptitude, ability to
communicate and a sufficient capacity to cope with
numerical data are key enablers. It is therefore
critically important that our school system helps all
young people develop as fully as possible in at least
these areas by age 18.

Too many young people leave school
underequipped for lifeâ€¦
Too many young people are still leaving school and
college without these attributes being adequately
developed. (Exhibit 43). It is particularly troubling
that a third of employers (33%) are not satisfied
with school and college leaversâ€™ attitudes to work.
Since this is the single most important consideration
when young people are seeking that critical first job
opening, developing a constructive attitude during
their schooling is fundamental to working life.
More than a third of firms are also not satisfied
with the technical skills (34%), teamworking (36%),
literacy/use of English skills (36%), and basic
numeracy (38%) of young people entering the world of
work. Half report dissatisfaction with young peopleâ€™s
ability to analyse problems (50%) and to communicate
effectively (52%). All these are essential skills for
effectiveness in life. An undue emphasis on GCSE
grades (or equivalent) and school league tables risks
distracting attention from the need to equip every
young person adequately with these capabilities.
More than half of businesses (55%) are not
satisfied with young peopleâ€™s work experience. The
governmentâ€™s decision to end the statutory duty on
schools in England to provide every pupil at Key Stage
4 with work-related learning is therefore a matter
of regret. While not every placement has been of
uniformly high quality, the emphasis should have been
on improving schemes, not abandoning the concept.
For most young people their work experience gives
them a first, critically important taste of workplace
life and the chance to reflect on the lessons of it. With
more than two thirds of employers (72%) not satisfied
with levels of business and customer awareness
among school and college leavers, work experience
placements can help young people gain practical
insight into why providing customer satisfaction
matters and routes to achieving it.
49Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
â€¦with IT the only area of steady improvement
Viewing employer experience over a longer period
(Exhibit 44), the one area of consistent progress
has been school leaversâ€™ grasp of IT (now seen as
satisfactory or better by 96% of employers). The
emphasis in schools on English does not seem to
have yielded lasting improvement, with the proportion
of businesses considering standards satisfactory
slipping below two thirds (to 64%) in 2014.
In other essential areas such as numeracy and
attitudes to work, there has been no sustained
improvement in recent years. The results show how
much still needs to be done during their time at
school to lay the essential foundations for peopleâ€™s
working lives.
The CBI has made the case for a broader definition
of success at school that incentivises the progress
of all young people and takes into account the wider
package of attributes and competencies that they
should have for success in life and work. A fresh
approach of this type is needed to refocus our schools
on tackling these important areas â€“ an increased
focus from Ofsted in inspections, for example, would
encourage and incentivise schools to place a greater
emphasis on these issues.

Employers want a clear focus on essential
competencies in primary schools
Businesses want to see primary schools focusing
on the essential competencies that make further
learning possible (Exhibit 45). Asked to identify the
three priority areas they believe primary education
should focus on, the top response by a wide margin
is establishing and achieving clearly defined goals
in literacy and numeracy (85%). Without sustained
progress in these areas during their time in primary
education, evidence shows that young people will find
it almost impossible to catch up. There is certainly
no room for complacency: one child in four (25%)
in England leaves primary school without reaching
expected standards in reading, writing and maths
combined.43
In over 750 schools in England, under
60% of pupils attain the expected standard.
Businesses also see it as important for primary
schools to help children develop appropriate
self-management and personal behaviour (52%)
and to make headway in developing the effective
communication skills that are so essential later
in personal and working life (a priority for 44% of
respondents). These are important skills underpinning
both effective future learning and success in any work
environment. Unless these become firmly embedded
during their time in primary school, it will be hard for
young people to thrive later in life.

The focus should continue to age 14
Businesses believe the focus on literacy and
numeracy at the outset of formal schooling needs to
be maintained in the age 11 to 14 phase of education
(Exhibit 46). This remains the top priority (cited by
62%). Communication skills and self-management
also continue to rank highly (43% and 37%
respectively) when business identify their top three
priorities. Unless young people can master these
essential enabling skills effectively, they will struggle
to meet the demands of working life.
In this early phase of secondary schooling, one in
four employers (26%) also sees a need for businesses
to support schools in giving young people a basic
awareness of the world of work. Businesses have an
important part to play from this stage of education
onwards in helping young people understand the â€˜real
worldâ€™ relevance of the knowledge and skills to be
gained at school, boosting their motivation to engage
fully with learning.

Businesses see the need to support schoolsâ€¦
For young people in the 14-19 age bracket, employers
want to see a much greater focus on work awareness
(Exhibit 47). Asked to identify their three top priority
areas for action in education for this age group,
respondents highlighted the need for businesses to
commit to supporting schools (52%). This includes
helping them improve young peopleâ€™s understanding
of the skills and attitudes required at work and
enthusing them about the options open to them.
Young people themselves recognise the need for
help in this area.44
They report that all too often they
find it difficult to connect the relevance of school and
learning to their future work aims. Current activity in
this area is reviewed in more detail in Chapter 8.
A third of firms (32%) also want to see a step change
in the quality of careers advice. Young people need
help to gain a better understanding of the varied
routes open to them and the qualifications they
will require to pursue them. The government has
recognised the need for change, issuing new guidance
for schools.45
Ofsted will also be looking more closely
in future at the quality of careers advice and support
available when they inspect schools. This follows a
report last year in which Ofsted found three quarters
of the schools visited were not implementing their
duty to provide impartial careers advice effectively.46
We return to this issue in Chapter 9.
In parallel with developing work and careers
awareness among the 14-19 age group, businesses
also highlight the importance of continuing to
reinforce the core areas of literacy and numeracy
(35%), communication skills (34%) and self-
management and personal behaviour (29%). Almost
one business in four (23%) sees it as a priority at this
stage in education to recognise a broader definition of
achievement, going beyond formal academic results
to recognise the positive attitudes and behaviours
valued in a work context.

â€˜My Educationâ€™
The Pearson and Teach First My Education report published in
November 2013 examines the views of young people on their
own experiences of the education system â€“ bringing together the
opinions of over 8,000 young people aged 14-21 across the UK.47
My Education looks at issues ranging from teaching and assessment
to the future ambitions and aspirations of young people, showing that
what young people want is an education that will prepare them for
success in life and work.
The findings of research undertaken showed that young people
themselves are focusing clearly on their future prospects, with 41%
of those surveyed citing a desire to achieve future careers goals as
the main driver that encouraged them to work hard at school.
When asked what they thought would be important factors in
helping them to achieve their goals, over 90% of those questioned
highlighted high-quality qualifications that are respected by
universities and employers, with 88% citing more of a focus on
practical life skills such as CV writing and 83% believing that more
opportunities for work experience and better careers advice are
important.
This research showed that young people want to learn more about
getting a job, managing money, different cultures and languages,
and generic work skills â€“ matching some of the areas where
businesses report lower levels of satisfaction with the skills of
school and college leavers (Exhibit 43).
Students were also asked what they thought the most important
skills they needed to learn at school were, and again this reflected
many of the priorities that business has for the education system.
94% of the young people surveyed, for example, thought that
communication skills were important to learn at school, 92% saw
confidence and motivation as important and 89% agreed that
employability skills should be developed at school.
What this research highlights is that young people are increasingly
thinking about their next steps and what pathways they will
follow to success, and that their priorities often reflect those
of employers. We must ensure that the education system and
the structures around it are geared towards supporting and
incentivising schools to deliver the education that develops young
people that are prepared to succeed in work and life.

Language skills can smooth the path to
business
While a focus on foreign language skills is not seen
by many as a top priority area for action in education,
only around one third of businesses (35%) have
no need at all for foreign language skills in their
employees â€“ and this is likely to decrease as we shift
towards a more export-led economy.
English is the international language of business â€“ in
itself a real benefit for the UK. But there can be great
advantages for British businesses if employees can
communicate with at least reasonable proficiency
in the language of clients, customers and suppliers
(Exhibit 48).
The vast majority of businesses (94%) do not require
a high level of foreign language fluency as an
essential core competence of their operations. But
conversational fluency in another language helps
in the conduct of business and can assist staff in
their careers. Over two in five employers (41%) see
foreign language ability as beneficial to the business
although not a recruitment requirement, while more
than one in four (28%) finds it helpful in building
relations with overseas suppliers, customers and
other contacts. Around one in six (16%) says language
skills assist staff mobility within the organisation,
facilitating international working.
Language skills are more highly valued in those
sectors leading the rebalancing towards a more
export-oriented economy. For example, over half
of manufacturing firms (51%) and a third (33%)
of professional services businesses say foreign
language skills among staff are helpful in building
relations with overseas contacts.

Given the dividends language skills can pay for
businesses, it is concerning that foreign language study
in schools has been under pressure in recent years.
There are some encouraging signs of change: some
50% of state schools in England report an increase over
the past three years in the numbers of pupils taking
at least one language at Key Stage 4.48
In about one in
five schools, however, take-up for languages remains
persistently low (below 25%) with no indication of
an increase. The jury is still out over whether recent
government initiatives to revive foreign language
learning will bring about a much needed resurgence.

Languages for new markets on the rise
The major European languages continue to be those
most commonly mentioned as being in demand
(Exhibit 49), led by French (50%) and German (49%).
The major European economies still represent â€“ along
with the US â€“ large export markets for British goods.
Over recent years, however, there has been a steady
rise in the proportion of businesses rating Mandarin
as useful. By 2014 this has come to be seen as
useful by close to a third (31%) of those respondents
identifying particular languages, reflecting the
phenomenal growth of the Chinese economy and
the expanding trade and investment links of British
firms. Spanish too is widely cited as useful (by 44% in
2014). Outside Europe, much of the Spanish-speaking
world is experiencing solid economic growth, opening
export and investment opportunities for the future
where some knowledge of the language may help.

section 8
Achieving a greater focus on work awareness among young people at
school depends on a high level of business involvement. Schools, colleges and
businesses need to work together as partners with the shared aim of raising
ambition and levels of attainment for all. By providing work experience and
becoming involved in other ways, employers can spell out the value of the
skills and knowledge developed at school and open pupilsâ€™ eyes to career
opportunities. They can also bring their expertise into schools and colleges
through roles such as governor.
Businesses recognise the
need to support schools
57Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Business/school partnerships are
widespreadâ€¦
The CBI has long championed business partnerships
with schools and colleges. As part of the wider
community, business recognises its obligation to help
schools raise ambition and levels of achievement
among young people â€“ the workforce of the future.
Many schools and businesses already have active
links, with eight out of ten respondents (80%) to our
survey having links of some type with one or more
school or college (Exhibit 50).
Where links exist, most businesses have increased
their scale of commitment (Exhibit 51). Over half of
employers (55%) with some education links report
they have increased their engagement over the past
year, while just 4% have cut back. This means the
balance of firms increasing their links with schools
and colleges over those reducing them stands at +51%.
â€¦Particularly in secondary level education
Connections are most widespread between
businesses and secondary schools (64%) and FE
colleges (63%) (Exhibit 52). This reflects the priority
employers attach to achieving a greater focus on
work awareness among young people in the 14-19 age
group (see Chapter 7). Links at the level of primary
schooling are only half as common, with a third (31%)
of businesses reporting links of some type at this
level. There is a strong case for strengthening and
expanding the scale of links between business and
primary schools. It is at primary school that young
peopleâ€™s attitudes, aptitudes and basic competencies
are being developed, so helping pupils understand
how much these matter for life beyond school can
be an important motivator. Links with students
at primary school age can also help to generate
inspiration and ambition around particular career
pathways and sectors from an early age.
Levels of engagement are highest among the largest
businesses employing more than 5,000 people. In this
category more than eight in ten firms have links to
secondary schools (89%) and FE colleges (84%) and
half to primary schools (49%). Even among SMEs,
however, nearly half have links of some type with
secondary schools (47%) and FE colleges (49%) and a
fifth (22%) with primary schools. In all, 70% of SMEs
have links at some level.

There are high levels of linkage across the
nations and at varied levels
Links between businesses and schools/colleges are
extensive in all parts of the UK (Exhibit 53). The scale
of connections is at or above eight in ten firms in all
four nations.
For the great majority of businesses (88%) with
connections to schools or colleges, those links are
made and managed at local level (Exhibit 54). A third
(33%) of linked employers, however, report operating
links at regional level and nearly one in five (18%) at
national level, often complementing local tie-ups with
individual schools and colleges. These links above
the local level are often in the context of programmes
to encourage young people in studying particular
subjects, as we discuss below.

Business support is focused on work
experience and careers adviceâ€¦
The single most widespread way in which businesses
support schools and colleges is by providing work
experience placements for students (Exhibit 55).
Close to four out of five employers (77%) with links
to schools and colleges offer placements. Among
those firms employing more than 5,000 people,
the proportion climbs to nearly nine in ten (88%).
Readiness among businesses to provide this type
of support is critically important in view of the
widespread concerns about the inadequate extent of
school leaversâ€™ workplace experience (see Chapter 7).
Two thirds (67%) of those businesses with links to
schools are involved in delivering careers advice and
talks. Given the long-standing shortcomings in the
machinery for delivering careers guidance, a high level
of business involvement is essential if young people
are to have a sound grasp of options and opportunities
and the qualifications they need to secure.
â€¦but businesses are also delivering practical
support
Schemes in which employers engage with schools to
promote study of particular subjects are widespread,
with one in three businesses (36%) taking this
approach. In particular, there are a range of initiatives
to enthuse and inspire young people about studying
STEM subjects to try and tackle the shortfalls in these
skills areas (Chapter 4).
School governance is another area where business
involvement can make a highly valuable impact.
Success in our education system depends on
excellence in its school leaders, backed and held to
account by assertive, confident and capable governing
bodies (Exhibit 56). A third of employers (32%) now
have members of staff acting as governors, who can
draw on their business expertise to help schools
and colleges run efficiently and effectively. This is
an important level of contribution, but there is scope
for further expansion. Recruiting good governors is
often still difficult for special schools and schools in
disadvantaged areas or under pressure from Ofsted
for rapid improvement.49
Their governing bodies need
exactly the qualities those from business can inject,
such as asking challenging questions, accepting
collective responsibility for the conduct of the school
and the ability to work as a team on complex issues.
Other valuable forms of business support include
enabling employees to act as student mentors (31%)
â€“ particularly important in raising aspirations among
young people from deprived backgrounds â€“ and
advice or other help related to running of the school
(27%) or development of the curriculum (22%).

Barriers to business involvement still
need to be tackled
Although the great majority of businesses now have
at least some links with schools and colleges, that
involvement could be extended and deepened if current
barriers were tackled effectively. The results of our
survey show slow progress in doing so (Exhibit 57).
When asked about any barriers to building links with
schools and colleges, close to a third of employers
(31%) say there is insufficient guidance and support on
how to make work experience placements worthwhile.
This has long been an area of concern to businesses
and the governmentâ€™s decision to end compulsory
work experience in England sends a negative signal
about the perceived value of placements.
Lack of interest is seen as a further barrier, but
declining in importance â€“ a welcome sign that the
school system itself is becoming more responsive
to the strengths of working with business. A fifth of
respondent businesses (19%) report that local schools
or colleges, or their pupils, are not interested in ties
to business. This is well below last yearâ€™s levels
(27%). There has also been a drop in the proportion
saying not enough of their employees are interested
in working with schools and colleges (down from
25% last year to 18% in 2014). Taking charge of
young people on work experience, fulfilling the
responsibilities of a governor and the demands of
mentoring or giving career presentations are not only
valuable to schools and their students, but can play a
useful part in the development of employees â€“ these
opportunities should be valued.
Other problems include the fit of work experience
or other involvement with the school timetable
(19%), the perception that involvement will be unduly
onerous (21%) and uncertainty over how best to make
contact with schools and colleges (14%). Businesses
report there is no well-publicised one-stop shop for
becoming involved.
Exhibit 56 Leading the way
Strong leadership and governance are essential to driving
school improvement, but as the CBI report Leading the Way
sets out, too many schools are not performing well enough
in this area. Strong and effective governance is about
giving headteachers strategic guidance and challenge, and
many of the skills needed on a governing body are linked
to â€“ and often developed in â€“ a business setting. These
include the ability to think strategically, understand and
interpret balance sheets, human resources expertise and
general management awareness.
There should be a real focus on encouraging more
individuals from business to volunteer as governors in
schools and colleges in order to drive up standards, and
that is why the CBI is now working with a range of partners
â€“ including the DfE and BIS â€“ on the new â€˜Inspiring
Governors Allianceâ€™ (www.inspiringgovernors.org). The
alliance is focused on championing and promoting the role
that school and college governors play and ensuring that
the right people with the right skills, such as those from
business, are in place on governing bodies.

The UKâ€™s economic prosperity depends on making full use of talent at all levels
and everyone deserves the chance to progress and make the most of their
abilities. But as the world of work becomes increasingly complex, young people
need guidance and support to enable them to understand the options open to
them. And they need support in navigating a route into their chosen career
area. The school-to-work transition is currently far too haphazard a process.
Businesses believe the quality of careers advice is simply not good enough and
is in need of major improvement.
Key findings:
â€¢	 The great majority of employers believe the
quality of careers advice for young people is
not good enough (by a balance of -77%)
â€¢	 The quality of careers advice young people
receive to help them make informed decisions
about future options in education is also seen
as inadequate (by a balance of -44%)
â€¢	 These weaknesses in careers advice are
reported by a large majority of businesses in
every part of the UK
â€¢	 There is a readiness among employers to play
a greater role in delivering careers advice,
with two thirds (66%) willing to do more
â€¢	 Short-term work placements of a week or
two are by far the most common type of work
experience offered by businesses (89%), but
almost half (46%) also offer longer-term paid
internships.
Young people need the right help to prepare
for working life
We need to do much more to help young people
prepare for working life. That is both the view of
businesses and of young people themselves.50
Nowhere
is the need for improvement more important than in
the transition from school to work.
Millions of people in the UK today work in jobs that
did not exist when their parents left school and first
started work. Changes in technology, markets and
customer demand open up new, constantly evolving
career opportunities. Arrangements to help younger
people into work that may have been adequate in the
past in a simpler, slower-changing economy are no
longer fit for purpose. If in future we are to make the
most of peopleâ€™s talents and ambitions, we need a
radically different approach.
Careers advice: not yet fit for purpose
section 9
63Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Better careers advice is urgently neededâ€¦
Effective careers guidance and inspiration is at the
heart of helping young people navigate the transition
between education and work. Current provision is
simply not up to the mark and businesses are seeing
no sign of improvement, judging by our survey results
(Exhibit 58).
Four out of five businesses (80%) across the UK feel
the quality of careers advice young people receive
is not good enough to help them make informed
decisions about future career options. Only 3%
consider the quality of current careers advice to be
adequate, producing a negative balance of -77%.
These worrying results are even more negative than
the views expressed by businesses in previous years.
In 2011 and 2012, a balance of more than two thirds
of respondents (-68% and -67% respectively) viewed
the quality of careers advice as failing to deliver to
the standard required. So there is a long-standing
problem that needs urgent action.
Careers guidance in England has never been good
enough, but handing over the entire responsibility
to schools without extra resource or support â€“ as
we have seen â€“ is unlikely to result in a system
that effectively supports all young people to
progress through education and into employment.
Analysis from the National Careers Council has also
highlighted the need for a rethink around careers
guidance in schools.51
Recent steps from the government â€“ such as the
publication of new statutory guidance for schools
on careers â€“ are welcome, but not sufficient to drive
the improvements needed to ensure that all young
people are prepared for life outside the school gates.52
We particularly welcome the references within
this guidance to strong employer engagement, as
businesses have a key role to play in helping to make
young people aware of the opportunities available to
them, to inform them about what it is employers are
looking for in potential recruits, and to inspire them to
follow particular pathways.

However schools, colleges and businesses canâ€™t do
this alone â€“ what is needed is some kind of system to
broker the relationships between these stakeholders,
to ensure all young people have access to the
information and inspiration they need to succeed in
life and work.
But real change will only come with government
acknowledgement of the scale of the challenge
and practical steps to apply a comprehensive new
approach backed by adequate resources. Careers
advice must move from being about provision of
information to being about helping people to navigate
information in a way that leaves them inspired and
sets them on a practical path to achieve their goals.
This is particularly important for young people.
â€¦across all parts of the UK
It is essential that the careers provision available to
young people â€“ and indeed to adults as well â€“ keeps
pace with change in the working world. Our findings
show there is good reason to believe that it has failed
to do so in every part of the UK (Exhibit 59). The scale
of dissatisfaction ranges from three quarters of firms
on England (a negative balance of -76%) to over eight
in ten firms in Scotland (a negative balance of -81%)
believing the quality of careers advice is not good
enough. This is a problem which requires urgent
attention from administrations in all parts of the UK.

Advice on education options also needs
improvement
The quality of careers advice young people receive
to help them make informed decisions about future
options in education is also in need of improvement
(Exhibit 60). Less than one in five businesses (17%)
view the quality of advice relating to education options
for young people as good enough, while six in ten
(61%) consider it is not adequate, producing a negative
balance of -44%. All too often, young people are not
given sufficient understanding of the qualifications
they need to enter the career fields they aspire to or
which subjects are likely to equip them best, with the
result that they find doors closed to them when they
leave school.
Once again, the pattern of weakness applies across
the UK (Exhibit 61). While in Wales a negative balance
of -39% of firms believe advice for young people is not
good enough when it comes to helping them select
education options, the negative balance rises to -47%
in Scotland.
65Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Businesses are ready to expand their input
Business involvement is an essential component in
ensuring that advice and information for young people
is inspiring, relevant, and â€“ importantly â€“ grounded in
the realities of the evolving labour market. Supporting
schools and colleges through involvement in careers
guidance, such as through delivering inspiring talks,
is already very widespread (see Chapter 8). Our
results show that businesses of all sizes are ready to
step up their commitment and further help to achieve
improvement (Exhibit 62).
Two thirds of businesses (66%) report that they are
willing to play a greater role in delivery of careers
advice in schools and colleges, strengthening existing
initiatives. If this readiness to help among employers
can be combined with a step change on the calibre of
other aspects of careers advice, there would be major
benefits for young people and for the economy.
But what we need is a system in place to support
schools and businesses in developing these
relationships to ensure that all young people
are benefitting from this kind of engagement â€“ a
nationally mandated, locally run system of brokerage
is something that deserves serious consideration.
Work experience openings take many forms
Weaknesses in practical work experience are seen as
widespread among many young people, as we noted
earlier (in Chapter 7). Traditional work placements for
a week or two are by far the most widespread form
of work experience offered by businesses (by 89%)
(Exhibit 63). These provide many school pupils with
their first taste of the workplace and what goes on
there. While they are a valuable introduction, their
limited nature means they can achieve only so much.

Almost half of respondents (46%) also offer paid
internships, normally geared to a somewhat older
age group and running for longer periods. These can
help students develop the attitudes and work-relevant
skills that are so important to employers. They also
give young people the chance to gain a taste of a
particular career or field of work so they can better
judge whether it is right for them.
Other approaches designed to give those on work
experience placements a better understanding of
work include job shadowing (37%), work on a specific
project (35%) and simulated exercises or working
environment (21%). All of these should be encouraged,
as interaction with employers and experience of the
workplace are some of the most valuable experiences
a young person can have in preparing them for
working life.

Developing the right skills in graduates
section 10
There will be growing demand for degree-level skills in the years ahead as
high-value, high-skill products and services increasingly dominate economic
activity in the UK. When this trend is combined with the current upturn
in the economy, it is no surprise that our survey shows job prospects for
graduates are improving. For the majority of employers, the attitudes and
aptitudes of graduates for work are more important than the specific degree
studied, so there is a need for graduates to strengthen their work-related
skills. Universities should be looking to do more to help them prepare for the
transition into work.
â€¢	 While many graduates leave university with
the skills needed for working life, businesses
still find too many do not: 17% report
shortcoming in graduate applicantsâ€™ use of
English, 23% in problem-solving and 26% in
communication skills
â€¢	 Businesses want to see higher education
institutions doing more to improve the
business relevance of undergraduate courses
(49%) and to help students become job-ready
(47%)
â€¢	 They would also like to see a boost to the
number (42%) and quality (27%) of STEM
graduates.

Graduate-level skills are in growing demandâ€¦
Employees with graduate-level skills bring
organisations the advanced knowledge, capabilities
and subject-specific expertise needed to drive
their future productivity and growth. Across the
economy as a whole, businesses will be increasing
their demand for people with higher-level skills and
leadership and management skills in the years ahead
(Exhibit 12, Chapter 3).
The demand for graduates and the value they bring to
firms is reflected in the fact that graduates are more
likely to be in work than those with lower levels of
qualification and less likely to become unemployed.
By the age of 35, graduates on average earn nearly
twice as much as those whose highest qualification
is equivalent to an A* to C grade at GCSE, with the
highest earnings among those who studied science,
engineering and maths-based subjects.53
â€¦and firms of all sizes are expanding their
graduate recruitment
Nearly nine in ten businesses (88%) have maintained
or increased their levels of graduate recruitment
during the past year (Exhibit 64). Just one in
eight businesses (12%) have cut back on graduate
recruitment while nearly one in three (30%) report
increasing their graduate intake, giving a positive
balance of +18%.
This represents an acceleration of growth in graduate
recruitment since our 2013 survey (Exhibit 65). At that
time the positive balance figure was +8%, based on
23% of firms expanding their graduate intake over the
previous year and 15% reducing it.
The increase in graduate recruitment has been
occurring across firms of all sizes (Exhibit 66).
Among the largest businesses employing 5,000
people or more, a positive balance of +9% report that
they have increased levels of graduate recruitment
during the past year, rising to a positive balance of
+25% among those employing 50 to 249 employees.
All too often, graduates tend to assume that job
prospects are greatest among large employers, but
the reality is there are good opportunities among
businesses of every size.

Graduatesâ€™ attitudes matter most of all in
job huntingâ€¦
When recruiting graduates, businesses are looking
first and foremost for the attitudes and aptitudes
that will enable them to be effective in the workplace
(Exhibit 67). Repeating the pattern of previous years,
this is the top-rated factor among graduate recruiters,
with nearly nine in ten employers (89%) citing it as
among their three most important considerations.
Over half (54%) rank it as the single most important
factor.
Despite the growing demand among businesses,
there will always be tough competition among
candidates for prime graduate jobs, so those aiming
to move smoothly into the world of work need to
take seriously the development of the right skills and
attitudes during their time in higher education.54
â€¦with business-relevant qualifications and
experience also giving an edge
Employers are also on the lookout for graduates in
certain subject disciplines. For around two thirds of
businesses, the degree subject studied is among the
main considerations (cited by 68%) but almost equally
important (cited by 62%) is having relevant work
experience â€“ gained for example through a business
placement or internship. Work experience can play
an invaluable part in strengthening the generic
employability skills of graduates, as well as providing
them with the opportunity to learn about a particular
sector or type of work.
Among the least important considerations is
the particular university attended (a top-three
consideration for only 12%). Businesses are instead
primarily focused on what individual graduates can
bring to the workplace.
There are varied avenues into workâ€¦
In seeking graduate recruits, businesses use a range
of traditional channels such as job advertisements
(70%), links with university careers services (61%)
and graduate recruitment fairs (47%) (Exhibit 68).
But technology has opened up additional means for
businesses and graduates to connect, and close to
half of employers (43%) report using social media as
an element in their graduate recruitment strategies.
Sandwich placements or internships are also an
important means for businesses to identify graduate
talent and for students to demonstrate to potential
employers the contribution they can make. More than
a third of businesses (39%) report recruiting through
this avenue.

â€¦but STEM subjects give graduates an
advantage
Studying STEM subjects gives students a competitive
advantage in the labour market (Exhibit 69). When
asked whether they prefer any particular degree
subject when recruiting graduates, nearly half of
employers (48%) say they prefer those with STEM
degrees (up from 42% in 2013). The mathematical
abilities and analytical skills associated with STEM
study are in high demand among businesses and the
degree courses are often seen as more testing than
some other subjects. Business (at 19%) is the only
other area of study attracting employer preference
above a marginal level, while more than one in four
graduate recruiters (29%) has no preference for a
particular subject. Instead they are focused on the
broader skills and attitudes that make graduate
employees effective in the workplace.
The employability skills of graduates are
too uneven
While employers are satisfied with the work-relevant
skills of graduate applicants in many respects, there
are also some worrying areas of weakness that are
particularly important for those aspiring to future
leadership and management roles (Exhibit 70).
Almost all businesses (98%) are satisfied with
graduatesâ€™ IT skills and more than nine in ten (91%)
with their technical skills. When it comes to numeracy,
powers of analysis and use of English, however,
levels of satisfaction start to fall. Around one in seven
employers reports being dissatisfied (14%, 15% and
17% respectively). These are surprisingly high figures
and businesses should be able to expect a reasonable
level of competence in all these areas among those
completing higher education.

Nearly a quarter (23%) of firms are also not satisfied
with graduatesâ€™ problem-solving skills, which should
be a prime output of higher education. Equally
concerning is the one in four employers (26%) citing
dissatisfaction with graduatesâ€™ communication skills.
Effective communication is central to almost all
high-skill activities and essential for those looking to
take on management and leadership functions in the
future (Exhibit 71).
One of the reasons relevant workplace experience is
valued in graduate candidates (Exhibit 67) is that it
helps to develop general business awareness. With
over half of respondents (53%) voicing dissatisfaction
with graduatesâ€™ levels of business and customer
awareness, there is a clear advantage for those
candidates who can show a good grasp of issues in
these areas.
Exhibit 71 The communications challenge
One respondent summed up the problems over
communication in these terms:
â€˜Graduates with good degree results can often
have very poor written and verbal communication
skills, including basic errors of spelling and
grammar. â€˜Text speakâ€™ proliferates. We often
have a need for basic business writing courses,
eg. how to write basic emails and basic
customer letters. This can carry through into
poorly developed written communication skills
as people progress in their careers, which
can become an issue when producing formal
business reports, customer publications etc.â€™
â€œ â€
Effective
communication is
central to almost all
high-skill activities
71Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Time for a rethink on HE programme design
When asked to identify the priority areas for action in
higher education, an emphasis on developing studentsâ€™
work-relevant skills is the leading area in which
businesses would like to see change (Exhibit 72). Half
of firms (49%) want to see steps taken to improve the
business relevance of undergraduate courses, while
only a slightly smaller proportion (47%) want to see
more done to develop students to be job-ready on
graduation.
As the economy recovers, there are also concerns
as to whether the right people with STEM skills will
be available to businesses in the years ahead. More
than two in five (42%) see increasing the number
of STEM graduates as a priority, while more than
a quarter (27%) are looking for their quality to be
improved. A similar proportion (28%) also want to
see more vocational options for higher study, such
as higher apprenticeships, to strengthen the UKâ€™s
technical skills base. Increasing the supply of capable
STEM-skilled people at HE level, however, depends to
a large extent on schools and colleges playing their
part in improving the pipeline. We will need to expand
existing routes â€“ and create new routes â€“ to higher
skills if we are to meet this skills challenge, as set out
in our Tomorrowâ€™s Growth report (Exhibit 73).

Exhibit 73 Tomorrowâ€™s growth: new routes to higher skills
In order to respond to the higher skills challenge, expanding
and promoting apprenticeships and â€˜learn while you earnâ€™
courses such as part-time degrees, are needed to equip
people with the right skills to deliver tomorrowâ€™s growth.
The UK has a strong track record on higher skills
achievement, but we need to quicken our pace if we are
to ensure international competitors do not overtake us.
More partnership-based provision, with greater levels of
business involvement in colleges and universities, and the
development of more flexible degree programmes is key to
addressing this.
There are already many good examples of collaboration
between businesses and HE institutions on courses,
particularly since fee reforms were enacted. Analysis
suggests that there remain some significant barriers to
developing the marker, which need to be tackled:
â€¢	 Financial support for those studying part-time
â€¢	 Access and visibility of information to learners of all ages
â€¢	 Alignment of incentives and goals with the desired growth
of the market
â€¢	 Lack of focus on the end goal of sustained employment.
72 Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Businesses and universities:
partnering for growth
section 11
Effective partnerships between businesses and universities are critically
important for the success of both parties and for our economic prosperity.
Businesses look to higher education to develop people with the right knowledge
and skills to meet their future needs and to access the expertise and innovative
capacity for which the UKâ€™s universities are rightly famed. Universities on their
side need business input to ensure the quality and relevance of their course
offerings and to create links through which research successes can be turned
into marketable products.
Key findings:
â€¢	 More than two thirds (70%) of businesses have
developed links of some type with universities
and nearly half of firms (48%) are looking to
grow their ties with universities in the future
â€¢	 The links take many forms, including activities
to enhance the business-relevance of HE by
providing â€˜real-lifeâ€™ projects and resources
to help students understand the practical
relevance of their courses (38%) and taking
part in degree programme advisory boards or
contributing to course content design (28%)
â€¢	 More than a third of firms (37%) currently
partner with universities for research and
innovation, seeking to draw on their wealth of
expertise and creativity
â€¢	 When selecting partner institutions, by far
the most important factor for businesses is
a universityâ€™s field of expertise/specialism
(79%), followed by its flexibility and
responsiveness (62%) and its location (52%).
Business-HE links can enhance growth
Higher education is one of the UKâ€™s strongest
assets, with a research record second only to
the US and institutions recognised as among the
best in the world.55
The recent government review
led by Sir Andrew Witty, CEO of GlaxoSmithKline,
into strengthening links between universities and
businesses rightly concluded that universities have an
extraordinary potential to enhance economic growth.
The full diversity of institutions have a role to play
from local SME support and supply chain creation
to primary technology leadership and breakthrough
invention. The report called for incentives to be
strengthened to encourage maximum engagement
from universities in a third mission alongside
research and education.56
Reflecting recognition of the potential benefits
generated by effective links between businesses and
higher education institutions (HEIs), more than two
thirds of respondents (70%) report links of some type
with one or more universities (Exhibit 74). Moreover,
more than a third of businesses (36%) plan to expand
their links to HEIs in the future while one in eight
(12%) plan to start developing links for the first time in
the coming years. This means that nearly half of firms
(48%) are looking to grow their ties with universities.
73Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
The links take a variety of formsâ€¦
Business-HEI engagement takes a variety of forms
(Exhibit 76). Graduate recruitment predictably
heads the list (cited by 66%). Reflecting the rising
demand for graduate skills, it has become even more
important than a year ago (52% in 2013). Provision
of sandwich-year and other placements also
ranks highly, together with offering internships for
graduates (offered by 42% and 39% respectively of
those employers with links of some type with an HEI).Exhibit 74 Employer links to universities

Our survey shows the extensive scale of links in all
parts of the UK (Exhibit 75). There are also business-
HEI links among firms of all sizes. It is particularly
encouraging that over half of SMEs (51%) report
that they have links of some type to one or more
university. Moreover, across SMEs as a whole, 27%
are looking to expand existing links and 17% intend to
establish them for the first time in the next few years.
â€¦with employers involved in enhancing
business-relevanceâ€¦
Almost equally widespread is business involvement
in providing â€˜real-lifeâ€™ projects and resources to help
students understand the practical relevance of their
courses (38%) and in partnering with universities
for research and innovation (37%). The technical
knowledge and capacity for innovation within our
HEIs are among the great strengths of the UK and
businesses are keen to draw on them.
More than one in four employers (28%) is also
involved directly in developing HEI course offerings
by taking part in degree programme advisory boards
and participating in course design to help shape the
content. These types of involvement can help ensure
that qualifications and course content are geared to
meeting real business needs while at the same time
boosting the employability of students. Although
larger employers tend to be most active in this way
(30%), nearly a fifth of SMEs (22%) are also involved.
As Chapter 5 showed, business looks to the university
sector as an important supplier of training and
development services. Among respondents with
links to universities, a fifth (20%) report collaborating
with HEIs on work-based and/or off-site learning
programmes for members of their own staff, drawing
on the expertise available within universities.
74 Gateway to growth: CBI/Pearson education and skills survey 2014
Expertise and responsiveness drive the
choice of partner
When it comes to selecting a university partner, by far
the most important consideration for businesses is
the expertise or specialism of a particular university
(Exhibit 77). Asked to identify the three most
important factors on which businesses base their
choices, nearly four out of five firms (79%) that have
developed links with HEIs say they aim to connect
with the leading experts in a particular field. Indeed,
this consideration is the single most important one
for three quarters (74%) of businesses.
Flexibility and responsiveness to the firmâ€™s needs also
play an important part for close to two thirds (62%)
of firms. So universities need to have clear points of
initial contact, effective signposting and a readiness to
respond promptly and positively to the requirements
of potential partner businesses.
There are clear benefits in easy access and
opportunities for face-to-face contact. Over half of
businesses (52%) with HEI links therefore identify
the universityâ€™s location as one of their three main
considerations. Given the important role many HEIs
play in local economies and communities, employers
are also often keen to help support and benefit from
their local university.

With higher tuition fees and a university system
increasingly driven by student demand, a quarter of
employers (25%) look to provide financial support
for students studying selected subjects. Support of
this kind can be important in encouraging people to
acquire the knowledge and skills most needed by
businesses and can form part of a recruitment and
development strategy. While the greater resources of
larger firms means they are more likely to offer some
student sponsorship (29%), even among SMEs student
sponsorship is practised to some extent (by 14%).
